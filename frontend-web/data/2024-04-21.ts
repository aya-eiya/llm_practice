He had been trying to prove the existence of quantum particles.Emily was curious and decided to run an experiment herself. With Max's help, she fired a beam of light at the screen. To their surprise, they saw two slits on the screen, but instead of seeing two beams of light, they saw one beam that split into two paths.The next day, Emily and Max went to her father's laboratory to share their findings. Her father was amazed by what he saw. He explained to them that this experiment proved the existence of quantum particles and that they behaved like waves and particles at the same time.Emily and Max were thrilled to have discovered something so important. They felt like true scientists, and their adventure in the world of science had only just begun.",
