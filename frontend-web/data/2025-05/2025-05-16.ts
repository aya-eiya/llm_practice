    "event": "The Bauhaus School was closed by the Nazi regime",
    "details": "On May 16th, 1933, the National Socialist government of Germany officially dissolved the Bauhaus, a legendary art and design school that had been founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919. The school's innovative approach to art and design education, which emphasized experimentation and collaboration between artists, craftspeople, and engineers, was seen as a threat by the Nazi regime."

  "title": "Ink Stains on the Facade",
  "body": "The Bauhaus School's iconic building stood like a hollow shell, its once-vibrant facade now dulled by the patina of time and neglect. \n\n As I stepped inside, I felt the whispers of past students echoing through the empty corridors, their creative energies still lingering in the air. \n\n I wandered into a dimly lit studio, where a lone easel stood like a sentinel, its canvas blank except for a few faint smudges of paint. \n\n Suddenly, the brushes on the palette began to stir, as if awakened by my presence, and started to move in rhythmic strokes across the canvas. \n\n Colors burst forth, swirling together in a kaleidoscope of hues, as the painting took shape before my eyes. \n\n I watched, transfixed, as the artwork evolved into a stunning portrait of Wassily Kandinsky, one of the Bauhaus masters. \n\n The image seemed to pulse with life, and for an instant, I felt like I was transported back to the vibrant days when creativity knew no bounds.",

      "Lui": "Yes, the descriptive language used in that scene was quite vivid. However, I did find it a bit too magical for my taste. As a history teacher, I prefer more grounded narratives."

      "Billy": "I see what Lui means about it being too magical. But at the same time, I think that's kind of the point of the novel. It's not just a story, it's an experience. And experiences are all about feeling and imagination."

    {
      "Meg": "Exactly! And I loved how the author wove together different themes and ideas in that one scene. It was like a little puzzle, but instead of pieces, we had colors and textures and emotions..."
    },
    {
      "Lui": "Yes, yes, I see what you're saying, Billy. But as a teacher, it's my job to make sure students understand the historical context and facts behind a story, not just its magical or emotional aspects."
