This division was made to allow military communications to be separated from non-military traffic, following a 1981 law that restricted the use of DOD funds for 'unclassified' purposes on the network."

  "title": "Split",
  "body": "On May 19, 1983, the ARPANET was torn in two, like a living thing ripped apart by unseen hands.\n\n The United States Department of Defense's network had been split into MILNET and ARPANET, with the military communications isolated from non-military traffic. As the division took hold, strange occurrences began to plague the newly formed networks. Equipment malfunctioned, data disappeared, and eerie whispers echoed through the lines.\n\n It started with small things: a misplaced message here, a delayed transmission there. But as time passed, the incidents grew more frequent and more brazen. People began to speak of 'the Split' in hushed tones, as if it were a monster lurking just beyond the edge of perception.\n\n And then, one by one, they vanished. The technicians who had maintained the ARPANET were the first to go, their bodies found with no explanation, no signs of struggle or foul play. It was as if they had been 'split' apart, their very essence torn from them.\n\n",
