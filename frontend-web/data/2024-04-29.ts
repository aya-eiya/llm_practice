    "In a world where everything is made of DNA, our young hero, Max, sets out on an adventure to find the missing piece of his family's genetic code. With the help of his friends and a talking strand of DNA named Dr. Gene, Max travels through the DNA forest, past the RNA River, and into the heart of the DNA labyrinth. Along the way, they meet other DNA creatures who teach them valuable lessons about genetics and family. But when Max discovers that the missing piece is in the possession of a evil virus, he must use all his knowledge and courage to save his family's DNA code and defeat the virus once and for all. With the help of his friends and Dr. Gene, Max saves the day and learns that family isn't always about genetics, but about the love you share with others.",
