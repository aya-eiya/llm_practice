    "The winter sun rose over Montgomery's streets as Rosa stepped onto the sidewalk. She had heard about Dr. King's arrest that morning, and how he was arrested just for sitting in a white person's seat on the bus. But what could one man do against all those buses and laws?  \n\n That day, something different happened. People began to talk quietly among themselves. Some said it wasn't right. Others wondered if they should join Dr. King's protest.  \n\n The next morning, Rosa watched as her neighbors started walking instead of riding the bus. It was strange to see so many people without a ride, but everyone had something in common - they were all standing up for what they believed was right. Dr. King's words echoed in their minds: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'  \n\n As weeks passed by, more and more people joined the boycott. They walked miles every day, just because it was worth fighting for. This simple act of walking changed Montgomery forever. It showed that one person could make a difference when they stood up for what was right.",
