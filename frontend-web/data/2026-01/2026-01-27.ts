    "It happened on that fateful day in January when the Apple Lisa computer was unveiled to the world. The sleek design and the innovative graphical interface seemed like a dream come true for anyone who had ever dreamed of owning their own personal computer. But no one could have predicted what would happen next.  \n\n As I sat in front of my new Lisa computer, the screen began to glow with an eerie light. The usual friendly interface started morphing into something sinister. Instead of the familiar blue background, it was now displaying a twisted version of itself - like a reflection in a dark pool of water.  \n\n The cursor on the screen started moving by itself, typing out strange messages that seemed to come from somewhere beyond our world. I tried to shut it down but nothing worked. Every time I attempted to turn off my Lisa computer, the power surged back to life with an intense blue glow that illuminated every room in my house.",
