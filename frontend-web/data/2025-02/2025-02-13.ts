    "It was February 13, 1895, and the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris was abuzz with excitement. The Lumière brothers had announced a revolutionary new technology that would change the face of entertainment forever. I stood at the back of the crowd, my heart racing with anticipation. What wonders lay before me?  \n\n The brothers took to the stage, their faces gleaming with pride. They introduced themselves as 'The fathers of cinema' and proceeded to show a series of short films that left me breathless. Each one was more astonishing than the last, but it was the final reel that would leave an indelible mark on my psyche.  \n\n The screen flickered, and I saw myself standing in this very café, but something was off. The patrons were distorted, their faces twisted into grotesque grins. I tried to flee, but my feet felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot. And then, I saw him – a figure lurking just beyond the shadows, watching me with an unblinking gaze.  \n\n As the credits rolled, I stumbled backward, my mind reeling in confusion. What had I just seen? Was it mere fantasy or something more sinister? I pushed through the crowd, desperate to escape the darkness that lurked within those flickering images.",
