    "It was a chilly autumn evening in New York City when The Beatles took to the stage of The Ed Sullivan Show. The crowd was electric, and the tension was palpable as the Fab Four prepared to perform for millions of Americans. But amidst the excitement, a sense of unease settled over one person: Jimmy, a young journalist who had been investigating strange occurrences surrounding the band's arrival in the city.  \n\n As he watched The Beatles perform 'All My Loving' and 'Till There Was You', Jimmy noticed something peculiar - the shadows on stage seemed to be moving of their own accord. At first, he thought it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but as the performance continued, the phenomenon grew more pronounced.  \n\n As the final notes of the show faded away, Jimmy approached The Beatles' entourage with a sense of trepidation. He had to know if anyone else had seen what he had seen. But the response was uniform: they knew nothing about any strange shadows. And yet...Jimmy couldn't shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.",

      "Billy":
        "Ha! Thanks, Kerry. But seriously, folks, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We need more evidence before we start speculating about time-traveling bands or whatever.",
