      "The Chicago School architects begin to develop the concept of 'the tall office building'",
    "details":
      "On June 8, 1889, a meeting took place at which the concepts of the Chicago School architects began to develop the idea of 'the tall office building'. The group included Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan. This event marked the beginning of a new architectural movement that would go on to influence skyscraper design across the globe.",

  "body":
    "In the year 2154, the city of New Chicago was a marvel of modern architecture. The skyscrapers that pierced the sky were not just towering monoliths, but also homes to the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world.  \n\n It was on one of these days that Dr. Rachel Kim, a renowned architect, stumbled upon an ancient text from the Chicago School architects who had pioneered the concept of 'the tall office building' back in 1889. The text described a meeting where Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan had conceived the idea of creating buildings that seemed to defy gravity.  \n\n Inspired by this discovery, Dr. Kim began to experiment with new materials and designs. She created a revolutionary new material called 'Aerogel', which was incredibly strong yet lightweight. With Aerogel, she designed a tower that could stretch higher than any building before it.  \n\n The project quickly gained attention from the scientific community and soon, Dr. Kim's invention sparked a global phenomenon. Cities around the world began to transform into megastructures, with towering skyscrapers that seemed to touch the clouds. And at the heart of this revolution was the spirit of innovation and progress, just as Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan had envisioned over 200 years ago.",
