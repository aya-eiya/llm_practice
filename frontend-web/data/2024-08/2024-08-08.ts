    "In the year 2154, humanity had finally reached a point where they could travel through space and time with ease. The invention of the Chronal Accelerator had made it possible for people to visit any moment in history, but it also created a new problem - the risk of disrupting the timeline.  \n\n A group of scientists from the Time Travel Agency were sent to investigate an anomaly in the timestream that occurred when the Transcontinental Railroad was completed. They found that a small group of people had traveled back in time and caused a chain reaction that altered the course of history.  \n\n The team leader, a brilliant physicist named Dr. Rachel Kim, realized that they had to find a way to correct the anomaly before it was too late. She assembled a team of experts from various fields - engineers, historians, and physicists - to help her navigate the complex web of time travel.  \n\n Together, they set out on a perilous journey through the timestream, facing obstacles and challenges at every turn. They had to be careful not to create new paradoxes or disrupt the timeline further, but they also knew that they couldn't just sit back and do nothing - the fate of humanity depended on it.",

      "Meg":
        "I see what you mean, Lui. But at the same time, it's a bit of a 'choose your own adventure' style book, right? So maybe that's why we didn't get as much depth from some characters?",
