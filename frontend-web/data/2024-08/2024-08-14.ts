    "It was the night of October 24th, and the city was in a state of panic. The stock market had just crashed, and people were running wild in the streets.  \n\n I was one of them, a young trader who had lost everything in the collapse. I stumbled through the crowded streets, desperate to find someone, anyone, who could help me make sense of what was happening.  \n\n But as I pushed my way through the throngs, I began to notice something strange. The lights were flickering, and the air was thick with an eerie energy. It was as if the very fabric of reality was beginning to unravel.  \n\n And then, in an instant, it was dark. The blackout had hit, plunging the city into chaos. I was trapped, alone and adrift in a sea of darkness.  \n\n But as I struggled to find my way through the blackness, I realized that I wasn't alone after all. There were others out there, people who were determined to survive this disaster and make a new life for themselves.",
