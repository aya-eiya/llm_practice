    "It was supposed to be a routine expedition, but the moment Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay set foot on Mount Everest's icy slope, something felt off. The air was thick with an eerie silence, as if the mountain itself was watching them.  \n\n As they climbed higher, the wind picked up, whipping their faces with icy gusts that stung like a thousand needles. Hillary and Norgay pressed on, their footsteps steady despite the treacherous terrain.  \n\n But it wasn't until they reached the summit that the true horror began to unfold. The landscape was barren and desolate, devoid of any sign of life. The two climbers were met with an unsettling stillness, as if the world had been frozen in time.  \n\n It was then that Hillary realized their climb was not just a physical challenge, but a journey into the very heart of darkness. And as they stood there, bathed in the eerie glow of the Himalayan sun, he knew that nothing would ever be the same again.",
