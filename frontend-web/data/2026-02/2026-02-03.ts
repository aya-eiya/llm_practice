    "details":
      "On February 3, 1877 (January 22 in the Old Style), Russian ballet master Marius Petipa and choreographer Lev Ivanov premiered 'Swan Lake' at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. The ballet was performed with music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and became one of the most influential works in classical ballet history.",

  "body":
    "In the year 2177, humanity had colonized most of the known solar system. The space station 'Dance on Mars' was a famous entertainment complex where dancers from Earth's greatest ballet companies performed for eager audiences from across the galaxy.  \n\n One such dancer was Sarah Chen, a former principal ballerina who now trained young performers in zero gravity. She had once been known for her perfection in classical roles like Odette in Swan Lake, but after a near-fatal accident during a routine jump, she had to adapt to new ways of moving.  \n\n 'You must learn to dance with the stars,' Sarah told her students each day. The space station's special gravity chamber allowed them to practice their art in near-weightlessness, using tethers and magnetic boots to move around the performance hall. They pirouetted, leaped, and spun through the air like celestial beings.  \n\n During a rehearsal of Swan Lake's famous 'White Swan' variation, Sarah noticed something strange - the music seemed different somehow, more ethereal than she remembered. Looking up at the ceiling where holographic stars twinkled, she realized that this was how it must have felt to be truly one with space.",
