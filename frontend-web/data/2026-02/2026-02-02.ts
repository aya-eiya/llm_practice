      "The Apple Macintosh 128K, one of the first commercially successful personal computers with a graphical user interface (GUI), was released to the public on February 24, 1984. It featured a built-in 9-inch CRT display and was the first mass-produced computer to come with a graphical user interface.",

    "The screens flickered in the dark basement of what was once a shopping mall. Sarah hunched over the keyboard, her fingers dancing across it with practiced precision. The computer hummed to life, casting a blue glow on her face. She had spent three days fixing this old Macintosh, salvaging parts from other broken machines.  \n\n Her eyes widened as she saw the screen come to life: a beautiful graphical interface that seemed like magic in this world of broken technology. The computer booted up, its hard drive spinning loudly in the quiet room.  \n\n She had never seen anything so beautiful - a window, icons, all of it just like in the old movies her father used to show her before everything went wrong. As she clicked through the menus, memories flooded back: schools full of computers, people typing away at their work. A world where technology was part of life, not something that made you vulnerable.  \n\n Tears welled up in her eyes as she realized this might be the last working computer she'd ever see. In the world above, they didn't have machines like this anymore - everything was controlled by networks and codes that nobody understood. But down here, in this makeshift laboratory, Sarah had brought something back to life.",
