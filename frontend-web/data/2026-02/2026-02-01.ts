    "The smog-choked streets of Neo-Vienna hummed with neon as I navigated through the crowds. A funeral procession was making its way, drawing more attention than usual. These days, only data ghosts and corporate vultures attended such ceremonies.  \n\n As a memory mercenary, my job was to capture and preserve the last moments of those who wished to leave their digital legacy behind. But this was different. The deceased was someone special - Ludwig van Beethoven had become one with the net after his death in 1827.  \n\n His funeral procession moved through the rainy streets, a sea of mourners singing his final hymn. I watched as they passed by, their faces illuminated by the neon signs and holographic displays. Each person held a small data crystal that contained fragments of Beethoven's work.  \n\n The night grew darker, and the city's lights seemed to dim in respect for the occasion. In a world where memories were sold like commodities, it was surreal to see so many people gather for someone they'd never known personally. But perhaps that's what made it beautiful - the collective reverence for an artist who had transcended time itself.",
