    "The clock struck midnight as I stepped into the dimly lit European Parliament building in Brussels. Something wasn't right. The halls were empty, yet whispers echoed through the corridors. My colleague had warned me about this place, but I dismissed her fears.  \n\n Moving stealthily across the polished floor, my footsteps barely made a sound as I approached the Treaty Chamber. The documents should have been here by now - the amended EU constitution that would reshape Europe's future. But tonight, they were nowhere to be found.  \n\n A sudden chill ran down my spine when I saw the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, standing in the shadows. His eyes held an otherworldly glow as he whispered, 'The treaty is not what it seems...'  \n\n As I turned to leave, the lights flickered ominously. The walls began to shake, and a dark figure emerged from behind Barroso's chair - Hans-Gert Pöttering, his face twisted into an unsettling grin. They were both gone by morning, but the Treaty of Lisbon remained, its secrets buried within its pages.",
