    "'The President did not lie under oath,' insisted defense attorney James Walker as he stood before Judge Thompson. 'The evidence clearly shows that the State of the Union Address was a calculated move to boost morale, not a deliberate deception.'\n\n\n\n The prosecution had charged Reagan with perjury for claiming his economic policies were working when they weren't. But as Walker pointed out, the President's words were carefully chosen and aimed at inspiring hope.\n\n\n\n 'Your Honor,' continued Walker, 'the law cannot punish a politician simply because their message differs from reality.' He gestured to a large poster displaying Reagan's famous quote: 'Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.'\n\n\n\n The courtroom fell silent as Judge Thompson studied his notes. After a long moment, he spoke, 'The matter raises serious concerns about truth and leadership in public office.' He paused again before continuing, 'However, based on the evidence presented, I find that the President's actions were not criminal in nature.'\n\n\n\n As the verdict was read, Reagan's supporters burst into applause. The decision sparked heated debate across America, but one thing remained clear: the truth about power and leadership would always be a subject of great importance.",
