    "The First International Exhibition of Modern Industrial Art, also known as the 'White City', marked a significant shift towards modernism in design. Held in London, this exhibition showcased innovative art from around the world, featuring cutting-edge architecture and design that would influence generations to come.  \n\n One of the most striking features of the White City was its use of white buildings, which provided a clean and minimalist backdrop for the exhibitions. This architectural innovation not only reflected the modernist movement's emphasis on simplicity but also served as a symbol of industrial progress. The exhibition's organizers aimed to demonstrate how modern art could be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.  \n\n As visitors navigated the White City, they were exposed to an array of innovative designs that pushed the boundaries of industrial art. From the intricate details of machinery to the sleek lines of modern furniture, every aspect of the exhibition reflected a commitment to innovation and progress. The White City's impact was felt far beyond its London setting, influencing designers and artists across the globe and cementing its place as a pivotal moment in the development of modern design.",
