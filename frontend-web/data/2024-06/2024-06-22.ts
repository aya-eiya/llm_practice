    "In a distant future, humanity had finally achieved peace after a devastating intergalactic war. As part of the treaty that ended the conflict, Earth's leaders signed the Cosmic Treaty of Versailles, imposing harsh penalties on the losing factions. The treaty created a new galactic order, with Earth and its allies emerging as the dominant powers.  \n\n But little did anyone know that the treaty had unforeseen consequences. As the cosmic energies released by the war began to dissipate, strange phenomena started to occur across the galaxy. Stars began to fade, and planets started to drift off their orbits. The once-peaceful cosmos was now on the brink of chaos.  \n\n As Earth's scientists scrambled to understand the cause of these anomalies, they stumbled upon an ancient text buried deep within the archives of the Cosmic Treaty. The text revealed that the treaty itself had harnessed a dark energy from the war-torn galaxy, which had been quietly manipulating the cosmos ever since. The implications were catastrophic: the very fabric of space-time was unraveling.  \n\n With time running out, humanity's greatest minds gathered to find a solution. They discovered that the only way to restore balance to the universe was to rewrite the treaty itself. But would they be able to do so before it was too late?",
