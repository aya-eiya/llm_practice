      "First Woman to Receive an Engineering Degree in the United States",
    "details":
      "On June 7, 1883, Julia Morgan made history by becoming the first woman to graduate with an architecture engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. While her degree was officially in civil engineering, she focused on architecture and went on to have a prolific career, designing over 700 buildings in California.",

    "The year was 2183, and humanity had finally reached the pinnacle of architectural innovation. Julia Morgan, a renowned architect from the past, had made it possible by designing the first self-sustaining city on Mars. \n\n As the inhabitants of this new world began to thrive, they started to notice strange occurrences. Buildings would shift and change shape before their very eyes. It was as if the city itself was alive. \n\n Julia's granddaughter, Maya, a brilliant engineer, had been working on a top-secret project to harness the power of quantum entanglement. She claimed that this technology could manipulate the very fabric of reality. As the city continued to evolve and change, Maya became obsessed with unlocking its secrets. \n\n But as Maya delved deeper into her research, she began to realize that Julia's true intentions had been hidden behind a veil of secrecy. The city was not just a marvel of engineering; it was a gateway to a new dimension. And Julia had left behind a cryptic message, hinting at the existence of an even greater truth waiting to be uncovered.",

      "Meg":
        "Wow! A city that changes shape? That's like something out of a dream! I wonder if it's friendly like a giant pet or maybe a bit grumpy?",

      "Kerry":
        "Maybe it's like a giant Transformer! Imagine a city that could turn into a spaceship and blast off to other planets! That would be epic!",

      "Billy":
        "But how does it actually work? What makes the buildings shift and change? It sounds like some kind of advanced nanotechnology, maybe even controlled by artificial intelligence.",

      "Meg":
        "Or maybe it's magic! What if Julia Morgan discovered a way to infuse the city with a life force? That would explain why it feels so alive.",

    {
      "Lui":
        "While the idea of a living city is fascinating, we must rely on scientific reasoning. Quantum entanglement, as Maya believes, could offer a potential explanation. It deals with the strange connections between particles at a subatomic level.",

      "Kerry":
        "Quantum entanglement? That sounds way cooler than magic! So, you're saying the city is like one giant quantum computer or something?",

      "Lui":
        "In essence, perhaps. It's a highly advanced concept, but imagine if manipulating these entangled particles could influence matter on a larger scale, even architecture.",

      "Billy":
        "That's mind-blowing! But what about the secret message Julia Morgan left? What if it reveals a way to travel to other dimensions through the city?",

      "Meg":
        "Ooh, a gateway to other dimensions! Imagine all the possibilities, different worlds, different realities! This book is way better than fantasy, it's like science fiction meets mystery!",
