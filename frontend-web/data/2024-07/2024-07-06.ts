    "The year was 1885, and New York Harbor was abuzz with excitement as the French ship Isere arrived, bearing a precious cargo - the Statue of Liberty. Professor Orion Wellesley, a renowned expert in chrono-mechanics, stood on the docks, eyes fixed on the copper behemoth as it slowly emerged from the misty dawn. His mind whirring with calculations and theories, he pondered the implications of this iconic gift to humanity.  \n\n As the statue began its assembly, whispers spread among the curious crowds about the mysterious clockwork mechanisms hidden within its metal frame. Rumors swirled that Lady Liberty herself held the secrets of time travel, waiting for some brilliant mind to unlock her inner workings and harness the power of chrono-mechanics.  \n\n Professor Wellesley's thoughts were interrupted by a young journalist, eager to uncover the truth behind the statue's clockwork heart. As they strolled along the waterfront, discussing theories and hypotheses, Wellesley revealed his own plans to decipher the secrets within Lady Liberty's framework, determined to unlock the mysteries of time itself.",
