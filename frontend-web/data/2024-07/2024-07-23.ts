    "As I walked through the ruins of what once was a bustling city, I stumbled upon an old camera lying on the ground. It was a Kodak, just like the one my grandfather used to take pictures with. I picked it up and examined it carefully, wondering how something from before the Great Disaster had survived.  \n\n I decided to take a chance and try using it. The roll of film inside was still intact, so I loaded it into the camera and started snapping away. It felt strange, like I was trying to capture a moment that would never be seen again. But as I looked through the viewfinder, something changed. For a brief moment, the desolation and destruction around me faded away, replaced by a sense of hope.  \n\n I took one last picture before the roll ran out. It was of the ruins themselves â€“ crumbling buildings, twisted metal, and debris-filled streets. I wondered what my grandfather would think if he saw this city now. Would he still take pictures, or would the devastation be too much to bear? The camera slipped from my fingers as I walked away, leaving it behind with its last roll of film.",
