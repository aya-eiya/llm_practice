    "The rain-soaked streets of New Eden were always alive with music, but tonight was different. Bob Dylan's iconic song 'Like a Rolling Stone' echoed through the neon-lit alleys, drawing in lost souls and cyber-enhanced rebels alike. I slipped into the shadows, my augmented eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of trouble.  \n\n As I waited for my contact to arrive, I couldn't help but think about how far we'd fallen. The once-great corporations now ruled with an iron fist, while the underground resistance fought a desperate battle against their surveillance state. My own past was shrouded in mystery, but one thing was certain: I had a score to settle.  \n\n The music stopped, and I tensed as a figure emerged from the crowd. It was my contact, her cybernetic enhancements glinting in the dim light. She handed me a data chip with a cryptic message, and I knew it was time to get out of Dodge â€“ or rather, New Eden.",
