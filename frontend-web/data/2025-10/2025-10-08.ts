    "details":
      "On October 8, 1970, the first commercial flight of the Boeing 747 took place when Pan American World Airways launched its maiden voyage from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to London Heathrow Airport with a route number PA200. The flight was piloted by Captain Stanley Haggstrom and First Officer Jack W. Main.",

    "The Boeing 747 stood eerily still on the tarmac, its engines silent as a tomb. Captain Haggstrom approached the cockpit with a sense of impending doom. His crew members had begun whispering about strange occurrences during their previous flight. The plane's instruments were acting up, and the passengers reported hearing whispers from within the cabin walls.  \n\n 'Captain,' his co-pilot whispered, 'I'm getting weird readings from the radio.' The sky above them turned an inky black, despite it being a clear night. The crew noticed shadows moving along the wing's edge, but there was no wind to carry them.  \n\n As they prepared for takeoff, the instruments went haywire. The altimeter showed negative numbers, and the compass spun wildly. In the distance, they could see lights moving across the sky – lights that shouldn't be there during a full moon.  \n\n The passengers began screaming as the plane's interior temperature dropped to near freezing. The cockpit filled with an otherworldly fog, making it impossible for them to see through the windshield. Captain Haggstrom felt his hands trembling on the controls as he realized their fate was sealed – they were flying into a place where the laws of physics no longer applied.",
