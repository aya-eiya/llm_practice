    "details":
      "On October 12, 1969, The Beatles performed their last public concert on the rooftop of Apple Records in London. During a break in recording sessions for 'Let It Be', they decided to play some live music and began performing songs from their upcoming album. Despite initial hesitation about playing music outside, they played several songs including 'Get Back' and 'Don't Let Me Down'. The impromptu performance was cut short when police ordered them to stop due to noise complaints from local businesses.",

    "The Beatles' final concert was like a cursed rehearsal from hell. As the sun set over London, their music echoed off cold walls, bringing dark memories back to life. We could feel it - an evil energy seeping through every note they played.  \n\n What started as a fun recording session turned into something sinister when the clock struck six. The sounds of 'Get Back' and 'Don't Let Me Down' floated up to us, but these weren't the songs we remembered from our youth. They sounded twisted now, full of hidden meaning and dark intentions.  \n\n The noise complaints began to ring out like warnings from the dead. But The Beatles just kept playing, their music growing darker with each passing minute. We watched as they moved closer to the edge, their instruments glowing with an eerie light that shouldn't be there at all.  \n\n Then it happened - the sound of police sirens pierced the night air, but we knew better than to think help was coming. The music stopped abruptly, leaving us in silence. But that silence felt wrong, like someone had stolen our ability to breathe. When we finally looked up at the rooftop, there were no Beatles left. Only empty guitars and a lingering sense of doom remained.",
