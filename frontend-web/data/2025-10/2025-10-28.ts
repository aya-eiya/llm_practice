    "details":
      "On October 28, 1919, the Weimar Republic officially recognized and funded the German design school Bauhaus in Weimar. This marked a significant turning point in modern art history as the school would go on to revolutionize architecture, art, and industrial design through its interdisciplinary approach.",

    "The Bauhaus Movement started as just an idea in my head when I closed my eyes at night. I saw walls made of paint and windows shaped like triangles, which is why the building became famous. Weimar people came from all over to see these magical buildings where art and life mixed together \n\n.  When I visited the Bauhaus Museum, the furniture seemed to move by itself under the bright sunlight streaming through those triangular windows. The chairs looked like they had been designed by robots, but they felt warm when you sat in them. Each piece of furniture told a story about what could be possible if we just dared to dream \n\n.  People say that Bauhaus changed everything about modern art and design forever. But what's really interesting is that it started with one simple idea: combining art with everyday life. Now, when I walk into any modern building, I can see the spirit of the Bauhaus Movement breathing through every doorframe and corner \n\n.",
