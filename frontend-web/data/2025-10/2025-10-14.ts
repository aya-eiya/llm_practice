    "The Black Friday crowds surged through the mall like a tide of desperation. Sarah tried to stay focused on her shopping list, but something felt off about the frantic shoppers around her. \n\n As she rushed toward the discount racks at Macy's, an elderly woman suddenly appeared in front of her. 'Please,' the stranger whispered urgently, 'I need your help.' Sarah hesitated, wondering if it was a scam or just someone having a bad day. But then she saw it - a black shopping bag clutched tightly in the old lady's hands. \n\n The woman quickly hid the bag behind her back as security guards began patrolling nearby. 'I'm being followed,' she whispered, 'they're watching me.' Before Sarah could process what was happening, the crowd surged forward again. She lost sight of the elderly woman in the chaos. But when she finally reached Macy's checkout line, her heart stopped - there, in a clear plastic bag on the counter ahead of her, lay what looked like human bones.",
