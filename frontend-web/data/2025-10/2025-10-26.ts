    "The air was thick with steam as Dr. Blackwood peered through his brass goggles at the city of gears and steel. Something was terribly wrong, he could feel it in the way the machines whirred and the smoke poured from every chimney.   \n\n 'What do you make of this?' he asked his trusted assistant, Mr. Silver, who stood beside him with a peculiar contraption in hand. The device looked like a cross between an old pocket watch and a medical syringe.   \n\n 'I believe it's the start of something quite frightening,' Mr. Silver replied gravely, his voice shaking slightly as he opened the strange machine. Steam began to rise from its core, spreading into the air like dark mist.   \n\n As they watched in horror, the steam transformed before their eyes into a thick, black fog that crept across the city. Dr. Blackwood knew without a doubt that this was no ordinary smog – it was something far more sinister. The Iron Plague had begun its reign over London.",
