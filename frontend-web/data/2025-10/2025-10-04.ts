      "On October 4, 1929, a major stock market crash occurred on Wall Street as thousands of investors simultaneously attempted to sell their shares, causing panic and leading to the Great Depression. This date marked the beginning of the stock market's free fall from its peak in September.",

  "title": "The Brass Butterfly",
  "body":
    "In the fog-shrouded city of Aetherston, where steam-powered airships navigated through coal-fired clouds, the mighty industrialist Lord Ashbourne presided over his iron empire. His company, the Iron Phoenix Syndicate, dominated the market with innovative brass machines that powered everything from streetcars to clockwork butterflies.  \n\n One fateful morning in 1929, as workers in their leather boots and copper goggles trudged through the cobblestone streets, whispers spread of a catastrophic malfunction in Ashbourne's latest creation: the Mechanized Butterfly Project. This extraordinary apparatus was meant to harness human consciousness through intricate brass contraptions, allowing the rich elite to pilot mechanized butterflies.  \n\n The project's collapse sent shockwaves through Aetherston's industrial heart. Banks reliant on steam-powered ledgers began to fail, while the aristocratic classes panicked as their investments in copper and coal evaporated like morning mist. Workers, many of whom had invested their life savings in Ashbourne's promises, found themselves adrift in a sea of financial ruin.  \n\n As Lord Ashbourne's empire crumbled around him, his prized Butterfly Project lay abandoned in the iron foundry, its brass wings frozen mid-flight. The Great Aetherstone Depression had begun, leaving behind a legacy of mechanical despair and steam-powered heartache.",

      "Lui":
        "The author's attempt at social commentary is appreciated, but it comes across as heavy-handed. The economic collapse was predictable.",
