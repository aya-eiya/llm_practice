    "The city was shrouded in a thick silence, broken only by the occasional whispers that seemed to drift from nowhere and everywhere at once. I had been living here for months now, ever since the great collapse that left nothing but ruins and shadows behind.\n\n\n\n They called me the Listener, because of my ability to detect even the faintest sounds in this desolate wasteland. But tonight was different - I could sense something was coming, a presence that felt almost familiar, like a memory from before the world went dark.\n\n\n\n As I stood at my window, watching the moon rise over the broken skyline, I saw it: a figure emerging from the darkness, moving with an unsettling grace. It was wearing what looked like formal attire - a black suit that seemed to absorb all light around it. My heart began to race as I realized who it might be, the legendary Silence himself, said to have survived the apocalypse and been hunting those responsible for its end ever since.\n\n\n\n The figure drew closer, and I could see its face now - the same piercing eyes and cruel smile that had haunted my nightmares. But something was different about this time... there was a glint in its eye that suggested it wasn't just hunting anymore, but searching for something or someone specific.\n\n\n\n As our paths crossed on that silent night, I knew that our meeting would change everything, and that the secrets of the past were finally ready to be unleashed.",
