      "George Eastman introduces the first Kodak camera, which allowed customers to take multiple photographs on a single roll of film without having to develop them immediately. The slogan 'You press the button, we do the rest' became synonymous with the company's innovative approach to photography.",

    "As the first Kodak camera sales began in Rochester, New York, my great-grandmother Elizabeth stood by her window, watching the world change through her camera's viewfinder. She had been a devoted user since its inception, capturing moments that would otherwise be lost to time. \n\n Her photographs told stories of love and loss, joy and sorrow, all preserved on those delicate rolls of film she carefully developed in her darkroom. The company's slogan 'You press the button, we do the rest' resonated deeply with her, as she pressed her own memories into existence. \n\n In her later years, Elizabeth would share these treasured images with me, speaking softly about each one, the emotions they captured frozen in time like those photographs themselves. Her hands, now gnarled with age, still remembered the tactile feel of film through the lens. \n\n When I finally held a modern digital camera in my hands, I felt her presence beside me, guiding my fingers to capture the essence of moments just as she had done nearly a century before.",
