    "It was April 15th, and the world had never seen a ship like the Titanic. It was grand and luxurious, with all the latest technology and safety features. But on this fateful night, disaster struck. A collision with an iceberg sent the great liner to the bottom of the ocean in a matter of minutes. The survivors were few and far between, but one young boy managed to escape the sinking ship and make his way back to the surface. He had seen something strange before he went under - a bright light in the distance. And as he struggled to stay afloat, he heard a voice calling out to him. It was an alien spaceship, who had been watching the disaster from afar. They offered to take the boy aboard their ship and show him wonders beyond his wildest dreams. Together with his new alien friends, the boy embarks on an adventure across the galaxy, meeting all sorts of strange creatures and learning about the universe in a way he never could have imagined. As they journeyed through space, the boy realized that even though the Titanic had sunk, his life had only just begun.",
