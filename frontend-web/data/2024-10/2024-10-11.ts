    "In the year 2157, Earth had become a desolate wasteland. Climate change and wars over resources had ravaged the planet, leaving only a few scattered settlements of humans who clung to existence.  \n\n Amidst this bleak backdrop, a team of scientists discovered an ancient steam-powered engine, hidden deep within the ruins of a long-abandoned city. The engine, which dated back to the 17th century, had been buried beneath the rubble for centuries, its secrets and mysteries intact.  \n\n As the researchers began to study the engine, they realized that it held the key to reviving humanity's lost technologies. They set out to restore the engine to working order, pouring all their knowledge and expertise into the project.  \n\n But as they succeeded in activating the steam engine, a strange phenomenon occurred. The machine began to emit a low-frequency hum, which seemed to resonate with the very fabric of space-time itself. Suddenly, the boundaries between dimensions began to blur, and the scientists were faced with an unexpected reality: humanity was not alone in the universe.",
