    "It was October 9th, 1907, and the streets of New York were in chaos. The Knickerbocker Trust Company had just failed, sending shockwaves throughout the financial district.  \n\n As people scrambled to withdraw their money, a sense of panic spread like wildfire. Banks were closing left and right, leaving thousands without access to their savings. The once-mighty institution of banking was crumbling before our eyes.  \n\n Amidst the chaos, a small group of investors saw an opportunity to make a killing. They began buying up stocks at fire-sale prices, hoping to cash in when the market rebounded. But as they dug deeper into their pockets, it became clear that something was amiss.  \n\n The Panic of 1907 had begun, and no one knew how far it would spread or what its ultimate cost would be. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the world watched in horror as the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse.",
