    "It was a beautiful day in April when Emma and her friends decided to visit the science museum. They walked through the halls, marveling at all the different exhibits. As they approached the physics section, they heard a loud noise coming from one of the labs. Curious, they peeked inside and saw Dr. Johnson demonstrating something amazing. Dr. Johnson was showing off his latest invention: an X-ray machine! He had just discovered how to make X-rays and he couldn't wait to share it with the world. Emma and her friends were fascinated by the mysterious rays that could see through objects. As they watched, Dr. Johnson invited them into the lab to take an X-ray of something. The girls couldn't believe their luck! They quickly decided on a small bird that had died in one of the exhibits. With a few quick adjustments, Dr. Johnson took the X-ray and within seconds, they could see the inside of the bird's body. It was like looking into a mirror. They could see every bone and organ in the bird's body. It was amazing! From that day on, Emma and her friends would always remember their exciting adventure at the science museum.",
