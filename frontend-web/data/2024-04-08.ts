    'On April 8th, 1543, the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat wrote a note to himself on the margins of a copy of the recently published work "Arithmeticae practicae" by Diophantus. The note contained a problem related to number theory and was to become known as Fermat\'s Last Theorem.',
  "title": "The Mysterious Note",
  "body":
    "In the quiet corner of his study, Pierre sat at his desk, engrossed in thought. He had been reading through Diophantus' \"Arithmeticae practicae\", a text that had captivated mathematicians for centuries. As he turned to a particularly challenging problem, something clicked in Pierre's mind. A problem so intriguing, so elusive, that he knew he must solve it. And so, with a flourish of his quill, he jotted down a note in the margins of the book, a note that would change the course of mathematics forever.",
