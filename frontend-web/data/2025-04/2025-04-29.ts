    "The darkness crept in like a thief, stealing the light from the world. It was as if the very fabric of reality had been torn apart, leaving only an endless void.  \n\n I remembered the day Charley Kline sent the first internet message, April 29, 1971. Who could have known that it would be the last? The message 'LO' burst onto the screen like a firework, but now it was just a reminder of what we had lost.  \n\n As I walked through the empty streets, the silence was deafening. The only sound was the creaking of old computers, their screens flickering with messages that would never be sent. I stumbled upon an ancient terminal, its keys still warm from the last user's touch. I hesitated for a moment before typing 'LO' again.  \n\n The screen flickered to life, displaying the message one last time. It was as if the world was trying to send one final farewell. But it was too late. The darkness had consumed everything, leaving only an eternal void.",
