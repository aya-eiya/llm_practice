    "The sky was a deep shade of indigo, with only a sliver of moonlight visible above the horizon. It was as if the world had been painted in dark, foreboding colors, setting the tone for a night of unspeakable terror.  \n\n I stood at the edge of the Grand Café, where the first public screening of 'A Trip to the Moon' had taken place all those years ago. The memories of that historic event still lingered in the air, but it was nothing compared to the madness that was about to unfold.  \n\n As I walked through the deserted streets, the shadows seemed to twist and writhe like living things. Every step felt like a betrayal, as if I was being led deeper into a nightmare from which there was no escape. And then, I saw it – a figure standing at the edge of the moonlit square, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.  \n\n The last thing I remembered was the sound of my own screams, echoing through the empty streets as the darkness closed in around me. When they found me, I was catatonic, unable to speak or move. It was as if I had been forever trapped in a lunar nightmare, with no escape from the moonlit madness that had consumed me.",
