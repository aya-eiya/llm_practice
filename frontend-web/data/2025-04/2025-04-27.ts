  "body":
    "I still remember the day my parents took me to a small school in our village. It was a one-room building with a rusty gate and a sign that read 'Compulsory Education'. My friends and I had heard rumors about this place, but we never knew what it was like inside. As we entered, we were greeted by a strict-looking teacher who introduced himself as Mr. Kumar. He explained that we would be learning the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic for the next five years.\n\n\n\n I was excited to learn new things, but my friends seemed hesitant. One of them, Rohan, whispered to me that he didn't want to go back home after school hours because his parents wouldn't let him play with his friends. I reassured him that we would have plenty of time for fun during our free periods.\n\n\n\n As the days went by, we settled into a routine. Mr. Kumar was strict, but he was also kind and helped us when we struggled. We learned about different tenses, such as the present and past, and how to use them in sentences. I found it fascinating to see how words could change meanings depending on the context.",
