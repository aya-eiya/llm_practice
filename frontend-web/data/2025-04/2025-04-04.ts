    "In the dimly lit, fog-shrouded streets of London, a lone figure emerged from the shadows. Aether, a brilliant and enigmatic clockmaker, had been summoned by the enigmatic Professor Chronos to repair his most prized possession: the Chronal Accelerator.  \n\nAs Aether worked tirelessly to revive the Accelerator's ailing heart – a delicate crystal orb that pulsed with an otherworldly energy – he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The Professor's obsession with the device seemed almost... desperate.  \n\nAnd then, it happened. As Aether coaxed the last remaining spark of life from the Accelerator's core, a blinding flash of light enveloped the room. When the dust settled, Aether found himself face to face with an eerie, ghostly apparition – the vengeful spirit of a scientist who had perished in the very same laboratory decades prior.  \n\nWith the Chronal Accelerator now blazing with renewed power, Aether realized that he had inadvertently unleashed a catastrophic chain reaction upon the city. As the clockwork contraptions that lined the streets began to malfunction and wreak havoc, Aether knew he had to act swiftly – or risk being consumed by the very machinery he had once mastered.",

      "Kerry":

        "That's a great point, Kerry. And speaking of responsibility, what do you guys think Aether learned from this experience? I mean, he had a chance to fix the Accelerator, but in doing so, he caused more harm... it's like, was it worth it?",
