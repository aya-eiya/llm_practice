    "Buster and Betty were best friends who loved going on adventures together. One day, they stumbled upon an old laboratory that had been abandoned for years. As they explored the lab, they discovered a strange machine with a glowing screen and a sign that read 'X-rays'. Buster and Betty had no idea what X-rays were, but they decided to turn it on and see what happened.\n\nAs soon as they flipped the switch, a bright light shot out of the machine and illuminated the entire room. Then, something incredible happened - they could see through walls and furniture! They realized that the machine was an X-ray machine, and they set out to use it for good. With their new X-ray vision, they were able to help their town by finding lost pets, uncovering hidden treasure, and even solving a mysterious disappearance case. Buster and Betty had never had so much fun, and they knew that as long as they had the X-ray machine, there would be no adventure too big or too small for them to handle.",
