  "body":
    "Once upon a time, after Sir Thomas Malory died on April 30th, the kingdom was in chaos. King Arthur's reign was over and no one could take his place as king. The knights of the round table were scattered throughout the land, trying to protect the kingdom from invaders. One day, Sir Lancelot decided it was time for the knights to come together and choose a new king. They gathered in Camelot and held a tournament to see who would be the next king. After many battles and tests of strength, Sir Galahad emerged as the winner. He was crowned King of England and led the kingdom to greatness. The knights continued to fight for justice and protect the kingdom, even after King Galahad's death. They remained loyal to each other and the ideals they stood for.",

      "Lui":
        "Well, Billy, you're not entirely wrong. The legend of King Arthur has been passed down for centuries, but the story is based on real historical events. Sir Thomas Malory wrote about the Round Table and King Arthur's reign.",

        "I love how the knights came together to choose a new king! It's like they were searching for their own 'Arthur' again. Do you think Galahad was the right choice?",

      "Kerry":
        "Hold up, isn't King Arthur just a bunch of old stories? I mean, who was he really? Some dude with a sword and a crown?",

      "Billy":
        "Actually, Kerry, King Arthur is based on a real figure, possibly a Roman leader or a British warlord. The stories were exaggerated over time to make him more legendary.",

    {
      "Lui":
        "That's right, Billy! The legend of King Arthur has been shaped by oral tradition and written accounts. It's a fascinating example of how history can be distorted or embellished over time.",

      "Meg":
        "I wish we could have a tournament like the knights did to choose our own leader! That would be so cool!",

      "Kerry":
        "Ha! Yeah, and maybe we could have some crazy obstacles to overcome too. Like, instead of jousting, we'd have to solve math problems or something!",
