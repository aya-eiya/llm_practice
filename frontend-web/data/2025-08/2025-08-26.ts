    "The summer heat clung to the city like a suffocating blanket as I walked through the empty streets of New York City. The film 'Pulp Fiction' had just been released, but this was no ordinary premiere night. \n\n Shadows began creeping across the sidewalks at an unnatural pace. The air seemed to thicken with each passing minute, as if something inhuman was lurking just out of sight. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were all being watched by unseen eyes. \n\n At precisely 8:26 PM, the sky above me darkened inexplicably. A cold wind swept through the streets, carrying with it a metallic scent that made my stomach turn. The sounds of distant sirens grew louder, more urgent, as if something had woken up and was hungry. \n\n In the distance, I heard footsteps echoing through the alleyways, but they weren't human steps - they were too deliberate, too purposeful. As I turned to run, my eyes locked onto a figure standing in the doorway of an abandoned theater. It wasn't wearing any clothes at all.",
