    "The neon-drenched streets of New Tokyo reflected off the chrome-plated hoverships that glided silently through the smog-filled air. Below, in the crowded underground metropolis, where every wall was a screen and every window a portal to virtual reality, the first prototype of the 'iNeuro' device was being tested by its creators.\n\n\n\n Dr. Sarah Chen, a brilliant neuroscientist who had defected from the megacorporation's rival in Japan, stood at the edge of the underground facility. Her team had managed to combine neural implants with quantum computing, creating an interface that could bridge the gap between human consciousness and digital networks.\n\n\n\n As she watched the test subject, a young hacker named Kyoshi, his eyes flickered with the familiar blue glow of the iNeuro's neural feedback loop. The device had already changed humanity's relationship with technology, but Sarah knew that this was just the beginning. In her hands, she held the future of human evolution - and with it, the key to unlocking the secrets of the digital afterlife.",
