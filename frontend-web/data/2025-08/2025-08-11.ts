  "body":
    "The city was asleep when I first saw him. A ghostly figure in a tattered tutu, dancing on the abandoned stage of the old theater. His movements were like those of the great dancers who once performed here, but something was different about this performer.   \n\n   As I watched from my hiding place in the shadows, his feet seemed to float above the dusty floorboards. The air around him shimmered with an otherworldly light that made me wonder if he wasn't a spirit at all. But then he looked up, and our eyes met.   \n\n   'Why do you watch?' he asked in a voice like rustling leaves, his words seeming to echo through time itself. I knew then why the theater had been abandoned so long ago - it was waiting for him, this final dancer who would bring an end to its long sleep of silence.   \n\n   'The ballet will live forever,' he whispered, and with one last graceful leap, his body dissolved into mist that swirled up through the ceiling of the old theater. The stage fell silent once more, but now I knew it would never truly be empty again.",
