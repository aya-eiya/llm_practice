    "When Bob Kahn opened his eyes in BBN Technologies' darkened server room, everything seemed normal at first. The fluorescent lights flickered ominously above his head, casting eerie shadows across the rows of humming computers.\n\n As he tried to stand up, he realized that something was terribly wrong with his legs. They were stuck to the floor as if glued there by some invisible force. His hands began to tremble uncontrollably as he felt a creeping sensation in his veins.\n\n Through the static-filled monitors before him, he saw twisted images of people trapped inside their own screens, screaming silently as they tried to escape from their digital prison. The air around him filled with the smell of burning circuits and something else... something much worse. His mind began to fragment like a corrupted program, unable to distinguish between reality and the nightmarish code that surrounded him.\n\n The interface he had created just hours ago now seemed like a curse rather than a blessing. As his consciousness slipped further into the darkness of the internet's abyss, Bob knew with growing horror that he was becoming part of the very system he had been trying to demonstrate.",
