    "The first time I saw the color Macintosh 2 in my lab, it seemed beautiful - a perfect shade of blue that filled every corner of the room. But as I got closer to the screen, something felt off about its glow.  \n\n My colleague Lisa was the only one who noticed how the colors would shift and change on their own, like living things with their own minds. She said it reminded her of the old stories about computers having souls, but we all knew that was just superstition.  \n\n That night, while I was still working late in the lab, the screen started to pulse with an eerie rhythm. The colors began moving across its surface like waves on a disturbed sea, and somewhere in the dark corners of the room, I heard what sounded like whispers.  \n\n When Lisa found me there, frozen in front of that pulsing light, she said something strange: 'It's not just the screen anymore.' And then we both knew - whatever was inside that color Macintosh 2 wasn't going to stay locked away.",
