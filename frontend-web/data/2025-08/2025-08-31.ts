      "On August 31, 1952, a severe air pollution event occurred in London, England.

  "body":
    "London was wrapped in heavy fog that night. The air smelled thick and toxic as Detective James walked through the streets. His partner Sarah noticed smoke coming from a factory building, but the owner had claimed to have closed it down months ago. While they questioned witnesses about missing people, another body was found near the old power plant.  \n\n The police had no idea how many more victims there would be before they uncovered the truth. The fog seemed to hide everything, including the clues that would eventually lead them to the real killer.  \n\n Back at the station, James and Sarah gathered their evidence and began piecing together the mysterious deaths. They discovered that several factories had been secretly dumping toxic chemicals into the river, causing people to get sick with strange symptoms.  \n\n With the help of a local environmental expert, they tracked down the culprit: a corrupt businessman who was trying to avoid paying for the cleanup. The fog in London's air wasn't just from old factories and houses burning coal - it was hiding an even bigger crime.",
