    "In the year 2154, humanity had colonized several planets in the Milky Way galaxy. The Crystal Palace, a magnificent structure made of crystal and steel, was built on one of those planets, Xylophia-IV. It was a marvel of engineering, a testament to human ingenuity.  \n\n As Prince Albert's opening speech echoed through the halls, a strange phenomenon occurred. The crystal walls began to glow with an otherworldly light, and the air was filled with an electric charge. Suddenly, the Crystal Palace was transformed into a portal to another dimension.  \n\n A team of scientists, led by the brilliant Dr. Rachel Kim, discovered that the palace's crystal structure had been imbued with the essence of Xylophia-IV's unique energy signature. This energy allowed them to communicate with beings from other dimensions, and even travel through time itself.  \n\n As the team explored the vast expanse of the multiverse, they encountered strange creatures and witnessed events that shaped the course of history. They soon realized that their actions in one dimension could have unforeseen consequences in others.",

      "Lui":

      "Kerry":
        "Hmm, that's a great question, Billy! A sequel would be awesome, but it'd also mean they'd have to deal with even more complex consequences. Maybe we can start a petition for another book?!",
