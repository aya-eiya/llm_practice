    "It was July 22, 1930, and the world was on the cusp of a new era. The sun's corona had been captured for the first time, and I felt like I was witnessing a miracle. I stood beside Bernard Lyot, the French astronomer who had made it possible, as he gazed up at the photograph with tears in his eyes.\n\n As we walked away from the telescope, he took my hand and told me about his dreams of capturing the sun's beauty. He spoke of a love that was like the corona - pure, fierce, and shining bright for all to see. I felt my heart flutter at his words, and before I knew it, I had fallen deeply in love with him.\n\n We spent the rest of the day lost in conversation, our love growing stronger with every passing moment. As the sun set over the horizon, Bernard looked at me with a smile that lit up the entire sky. 'You are my corona,' he whispered, and I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be.",
