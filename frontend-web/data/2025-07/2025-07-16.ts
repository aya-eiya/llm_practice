  "body": "The city was ablaze with excitement as the news broke: the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932 had been signed into law. President Herbert Hoover's pen had sealed the fate of commercial and investment banking, separating them like oil and water. But little did anyone know that this act would have far-reaching consequences, plunging the world into a web of intrigue and deceit.  \n\nI stood at the edge of the bustling streets, my eyes fixed on the imposing structure of the Federal Reserve. It was here, in these very walls, that the true power brokers held court. They whispered secrets to each other, their fingers tracing the outlines of the city's future. And I knew, with a shiver running down my spine, that I had stumbled into something much bigger than myself.  \n\nAs I delved deeper, the shadows grew darker, and the air thickened with anticipation. It was as if the very fabric of society was being manipulated, like a master puppeteer controlling his strings. And I, mere mortal that I was, felt like a tiny pawn in their game.",

      "Meg": "I loved how the novel was set in a different time period, it really immersed me in the story!"

    {
      "Lui": "Yes, the author did an excellent job of transporting you to the past, but I think they could have done more with the plot itself."

    {
      "Billy": "I agree with Lui, the plot was kind of predictable and didn't blow my mind like I expected it to. But I still enjoyed it!"

      "Meg": "Yeah, I was kind of confused about why they focused so much on the Federal Reserve and not as much on the people affected by the act. It felt like we were missing out on some important context."

      "Lui": "Well, I think that's where the author intended for us to fill in the gaps with our own research and understanding of the subject matter. It's not just about reading a novel, it's about engaging with the material itself."
    },
    {
      "Billy": "That makes sense, but I still wish they'd provided more background information on the time period and how it affected people like us today!"
    },
    {
      "Kerry": "Yeah, I see what Lui means. Maybe next time we can read a book that's not so focused on the actual events themselves, but rather on the characters and their experiences."
