    "In the year 2154, humanity had finally cracked the code to harnessing the power of sound waves. The invention of the Echo Recorder by Valdemar Poulsen's descendants revolutionized the way people communicated across vast distances.  \n\n With the Echo Recorder, one could record and replay conversations that transcended time and space. People used it for everything from business meetings to intimate moments with loved ones. But as the years went by, a new phenomenon emerged - echoes of memories, long forgotten, began resurfacing in people's minds.  \n\n They called them 'Sound Revenants' - echoes that haunted the living, revealing secrets and experiences from the past. Those who had experienced the most profound Sound Revenants were sought after for their expertise. And so, a new profession was born - the Echo Seekers.  \n\n As an Echo Seeker, I had encountered countless Sound Revenants, each one a thread in the intricate tapestry of human history. But none had ever captivated me as much as the faint echo of my own grandmother's laughter.",
