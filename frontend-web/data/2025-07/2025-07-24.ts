  "body": "It was July 24, 1993, and Intel had just unveiled its new Pentium processor at a conference in Beijing. The room was filled with excitement as the company's representatives demonstrated the incredible speed and power of their latest innovation. But little did they know, this was not just any ordinary technological advancement.  \n\n As soon as the demonstration ended, strange occurrences began to happen. Equipment malfunctioned, people became disoriented, and some even reported seeing visions of a dark, ominous future. The conference attendees were initially dismissed as mere paranoia, but soon, it became clear that something was amiss.  \n\n Those who had witnessed the demonstration started experiencing vivid nightmares and an unshakeable feeling of impending doom. They would see glimpses of a world in shambles, with cities reduced to rubble and people fleeing in terror. It was as if the Pentium processor had somehow tapped into a dark energy that threatened to consume everything.  \n\n As the days went by, the phenomenon spread like wildfire, engulfing entire cities and leaving destruction in its wake. The world teetered on the brink of chaos, and it became clear that Intel's demonstration had unleashed a horror beyond their wildest imagination.",
