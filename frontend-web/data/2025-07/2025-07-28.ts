  "body": "In the year 2256, humanity had colonized several planets in the distant reaches of the galaxy. The United Galactic Council had been established to maintain peace and order among the colonies. However, a strange phenomenon began to occur, where events from the past would start to repeat themselves. \n\n The first event was the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring' in 1913. The performance was marked by audience disturbance and eventual riot. But this time, it was not just a physical occurrence. People began to relive their past experiences, as if they were trapped in a never-ending loop. \n\n Astronomer Dr. Sophia Patel discovered that the phenomenon was caused by an anomaly in the space-time continuum. She proposed a theory that events from the past were being echoed into the present due to a rift in the fabric of time itself. \n\n As the echoes continued, society began to break down. People became trapped in their own memories, reliving the same moments over and over again. The United Galactic Council struggled to maintain order, but it seemed like a losing battle against the tide of nostalgia.",
