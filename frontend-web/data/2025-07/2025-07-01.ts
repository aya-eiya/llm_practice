  "title": "The Last Rail",
  "body":
    "In the year 2176, humanity had finally achieved what was thought to be impossible - a transcontinental railroad that spanned across the entire planet. The last rail was laid on the outskirts of New Eden, connecting the East and West Coasts in a feat of engineering marvel.  \n\n As I stood at the Promontory Summit, where the first train had been launched decades ago, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and wonder. The gleaming steel tracks stretched out before me like a serpent, carrying with it the dreams and aspirations of generations past and present.  \n\n But little did we know, this achievement came at a great cost. The massive energy source required to power the trains had begun to destabilize the planet's ecosystem, threatening to unravel the very fabric of our society. It was then that I stumbled upon an ancient text hidden deep within the archives of New Eden, warning us of the dangers of unchecked progress.  \n\n The words echoed in my mind like a prophecy: 'The last rail will be the final nail in humanity's coffin.' I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were racing towards a catastrophic future, one that would forever change the course of our history.",
