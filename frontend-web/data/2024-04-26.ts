  "body": "One day, after the accident at the power plant, Sarah went to play in the woods. She heard a strange noise and looked up to see a strange green glow coming from the direction of the power plant. As she got closer, she saw that the power plant was on fire and smoke was billowing into the sky. Sarah ran back home as fast as she could, but when she got there, her parents were gone. They had gone to see what had happened at the power plant. Days went by, and no one returned from the power plant. Sarah started to worry about her parents. She decided to go back to the power plant to look for them. When she arrived, she saw that the power plant was completely destroyed and radioactive waste was leaking into the ground. Sarah ran away as fast as she could, but she felt strange and weak. When she got home, she realized that she had been contaminated with radiation from the disaster. She went to the hospital and stayed there for weeks. Sarah never forgot that day and the horror it brought.",
