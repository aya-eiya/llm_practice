    "In my steam-powered observatory, I watched as the great clockwork planet Neptune drifted through our night sky. The brass gears in our telescope's housing ticked steadily, marking time like a patient guardian.      \n\n My master clockmaker had always said that Neptune's orbit was predictable by mathematical calculations, but nothing could have prepared us for what we were about to discover. As the morning light began to filter through our workshop's stained glass windows, I noticed something peculiar in the planet's path.      \n\n The brass wheels on my desk spun faster as I consulted the astronomical charts that had been drawn up by the great French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier. According to his calculations, Neptune should be making its closest approach to Earth right about now.      \n\n My eyes widened in wonder as I adjusted our telescope's focus, and there it was - a magnificent blue planet gliding through the constellations like a celestial ship on a cosmic sea. As we continued to observe it through the day, the steam-powered chronometers in our workshop began to tick with renewed purpose, marking each passing moment of this extraordinary discovery.",
