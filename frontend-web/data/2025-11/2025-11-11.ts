    "The dark screen loomed before me, its empty glow mocking my existence as I waited for Apple to release their new operating system.  \n\n Something felt off. The computer's fans whirred with an unsettling rhythm, and the keyboard keys clicked softly under my trembling fingers.  \n\n As midnight approached, the room grew colder. My breath fogged up the window like a ghostly presence, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the system was watching me, judging every move I made with its cold, digital eyes.  \n\n Just as I was about to leave, the screen flickered to life. 'macOS Monterey,' it displayed in glowing letters. But something wasn't right – the interface seemed different, almost malevolent in its perfection. The cursor moved on its own, beckoning me closer to the dark secrets hidden within the system.  \n\n As I reached for the mouse, the room plunged into darkness. The only light came from my screen, casting eerie shadows across the walls as the computer welcomed me with a chilling digital voice: 'Hello, new user.'",
