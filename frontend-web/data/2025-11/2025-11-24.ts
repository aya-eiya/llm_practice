    "The Bauhaus School's grand building stood in the darkness like a silent predator, its windows glowing with an eerie blue light that seemed to mock those who tried to escape its grasp. The new students had arrived just days before, their eyes bright with hope and curiosity. But now, as midnight approached, something felt terribly wrong.\n\nThe building's corridors stretched endlessly into the night, each step echoing through the empty halls like a funeral march. Strange shadows danced across the walls, taking on shapes that shouldn't be possible in the real world. The students had started to hear whispers - soft, melodious voices speaking in languages they didn't understand.\n\nAs they ventured deeper into the building, the air grew thick with an otherworldly presence. Their art supplies began to move on their own, brushes scrawling lines of black ink across pristine white surfaces. The Bauhaus School was a place of beauty and innovation, but in the dead of night, it became something far more sinister - a portal to horrors that lay beyond the veil of reality.\n\nAnd as dawn broke through the windows like a crimson bloodstain, the students realized with horror that they had become part of the Bauhaus School's dark legacy. The building would never let them go, and their art would forever bear the mark of its shadowy influence.",

      "Kerry":
        "Dude, that novel was wild! The way it twisted the concept of a prestigious school into something sinister is brilliant. I especially loved the supernatural elements and how reality started bending.",

      "Billy":
        "You know what's cool? The way they integrated mathematical patterns into the supernatural elements. It made me think of how symmetry is often found in both art and nature, even in scary things!",

      "Kerry":
        "I was thinking - have any of you ever seen real architecture that looks like it could be a portal to another dimension? Because some buildings I've seen definitely give me the creeps.",

    {
      "Meg":
        "The symbolism was so rich! The crimson dawn breaking through those windows really drove home the idea of inevitable doom. It's like the light is tainted by what happened in the night.",

    {
      "Lui":
        "While the supernatural elements were engaging, I did notice that it might give students a skewed view of artistic movements and historical periods. But as a cautionary tale about the darker aspects of creative expression, it works quite well.",
