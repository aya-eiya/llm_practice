    "The ancient recording studio creaked with every step, as if Hey Jude was still playing on its cursed vinyl player. The air smelled of rotten tape and something far worse - the lingering scent of Paul McCartney's ghost, trapped in that haunting melody.  \n\n My research into paranormal recordings led me to this abandoned facility, where they claim The Beatles made their final dark recordings. As I approached the control room, the fluorescent lights flickered wildly, casting eerie shadows on the walls like a macabre ballet.  \n\n The equipment still hummed with an unnatural energy, as if fueled by the collective screams of listeners who couldn't stop playing that damned song. In the mixing booth, I found a logbook filled with cryptic notes and dates - all leading up to November 21, 1968, when 'Hey Jude' was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world.  \n\n The final note on the page read: 'It's getting worse by the day. We can't stop it now.' I should have turned back then, but like a moth drawn to flame, I had to hear the end of that song - even if my sanity would be the price.",
