    "In a world where numbers danced eternal, the great mathematicians had been silenced forever. Their minds, once brilliant with solutions to ancient problems, were now frozen in time. The last one to solve Euler's riddle lay buried beneath the city, his secrets locked away like precious gems.  \n\n I was part of the Number Keepers, an elite group tasked with protecting these mathematical truths. Each morning, we would gather at dawn to recite the sum of the squares - pi squared, eternal and unchanging. The others in my circle whispered about a new solution discovered by a rogue mathematician, but none dared speak it aloud.  \n\n As I walked through the city's abandoned streets, my boots echoing against the concrete, I felt the weight of our lost knowledge pressing down on me. Somewhere, hidden from our prying eyes, another scholar might have stumbled upon Euler's true secret. But we would never know, for in this age of silence, only the dead could speak truthfully about pi.",
