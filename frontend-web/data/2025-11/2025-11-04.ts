    "Dorothea Lange was my grandmother. She died long ago during a time called the Great Depression. But even now, when the world is dying, I still carry her old camera around my neck.\n\n\n\n The city outside my window looks nothing like the pictures she took. Where there used to be tall buildings and busy streets, now there are only ruins and dust. She photographed people in hunger during that time, but this... this is worse.\n\n\n\n I found her old photographs buried under our collapsed house. They show a city full of life, just like the ones she captured with her camera back then. But now, after all these years, everything is gone. The world we knew has disappeared forever.\n\n\n\n As I look through her lens at what's left of San Francisco, I can't help but think that she would be proud to see how far humanity has fallen. She always believed in capturing the truth, no matter how painful it might be.",
