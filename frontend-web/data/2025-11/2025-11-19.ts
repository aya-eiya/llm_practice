      "The first Apple Store, located at One Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California, opened its doors to the public on November 19, 2001. This marked a significant shift in Apple's retail strategy, moving from being primarily a mail-order and reseller company to becoming a major player in brick-and-mortar retail.",

    "When I drove up to the old Apple Store location at One Infinite Loop, something felt terribly wrong. The building stood there like a ghost, windows dark and empty. It was supposed to be a historic landmark now, but instead it looked abandoned.\n\n\n\n As I got out of my car, the wind seemed to whisper 'don't go inside.' But I had to see what happened that day in 2001. The door creaked open with an eerie moan as if welcoming me home.\n\n\n\n Inside, everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. Broken screens lined the walls like dark mirrors reflecting my fears. In the center of the store stood a giant Apple logo, but its color had turned to blood red. Suddenly, all the screens flickered to life with ghostly faces watching me.\n\n\n\n I tried to run, but the door slammed shut behind me. The air grew thick with an electric charge. As I looked around one last time, the lights dimmed and plunged us into darkness.\n\n\n\n They found my car parked outside two days later, engine still running. But no sign of me. To this day, people say they can hear screams coming from inside that old Apple Store at night.",

      "Billy":
        "I found it fascinating how the author described that abandoned Apple Store as if it had a life of its own. The way he used supernatural elements to tell a haunting story was really clever!",
    },
    {
      "Meg":
        "Oh my goodness, Billy! You're totally right about the creepy atmosphere. The ghostly faces on the screens and the blood red logo were so eerie, but I love how it made me feel like something supernatural was lurking in that empty building.",
    },
    {
      "Kerry":
        "I'm still trying to figure out if this is a horror story or some kind of allegory for modern technology. The way the author twisted reality with those ghostly faces and screams at night... it's really thought-provoking, isn't it?",
    },
    {
      "Lui":
        "While I appreciate the creative storytelling, students should be aware that this novel contains mature themes and horror elements that might not be suitable for younger readers. As an educator, I'd want to discuss these themes carefully in a classroom setting.",
    },
    {
      "Billy":
        "I agree with Mr. Lui about being careful with mature themes, but I still think this story is brilliant! The way the author builds suspense and uses supernatural elements to tell a dark tale was incredibly effective!",
    },
    {
      "Meg":
        "Absolutely, Billy! And I love how it made me feel like I was right there in that creepy Apple Store, experiencing all those terrifying moments firsthand. It's like being inside a real-life haunted house story!",
    },
    {
      "Kerry":
        "You know what's funny? Even though this is supposed to be a horror story, it kind of makes you wonder if some of these elements are based on real events or just creative fiction. That's what I love about analyzing stories like this - there's always something deeper to explore!",
    },
    {
      "Lui":
        "Great point, Kerry! This novel does invite readers to consider the darker aspects of modern technology and society. As educators, we should use these kinds of books as opportunities for meaningful discussions about ethics, morality, and human nature.",
