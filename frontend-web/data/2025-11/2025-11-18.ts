      "On November 18, 1877, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet 'Swan Lake' was first performed at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. The original choreography by Julius Reininger and the famous white swan dance were created for this premiere.",

    "The Bolshoi Theatre on Earth was just one of many dance stages across our solar system now. On Mars Colony, the premiere performance of 'Swan Lake' would begin in exactly twenty minutes.\n\n\n\n\nJulia, a Russian dancer who had trained at the original Bolshoi Theatre before moving to Mars, felt her heart flutter as she prepared for her famous white swan dance. She looked out at the red desert landscape below, thinking about how different space was from Earth's theatres.\n\n\n\n\nThe music of Tchaikovsky filled the air as she began her solo performance. The gravity on Mars made every move slightly different than what she had practiced in Earth's low-gravity conditions. But Julia was determined to make it perfect, just like at the original premiere.\n\n\n\n\nAs she pirouetted across the stage, the audience gasped with wonder. In their seats were both Martians and visiting humans from across the solar system. No one had ever seen 'Swan Lake' performed quite this way before.",
