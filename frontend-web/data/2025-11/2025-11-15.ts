    "The music began to seep through the walls of my old Victorian home, a haunting melody that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly rhythm. The Beatles' earliest recordings had always given me chills, but this was different – their songs now felt like warnings from beyond the grave.  \n\nI crept upstairs, determined to find the source of the eerie tunes. As I approached my daughter's bedroom, the sounds grew louder and more sinister. Through her door, I witnessed something that no mortal should ever see: an apparition of a young man in mod clothes, his spectral fingers moving across a phantom record player.  \n\nThe phantom began to sing 'Love Me Do' with an unsettling intensity, its voice carrying the weight of centuries. With each note, my daughter's bed began to rise from the floor, as if drawn by some otherworldly force. I watched in horror as she opened her eyes, revealing nothing but black voids where pupils should be.  \n\nThe phantom turned to face me, its ghostly form now illuminated by an unearthly glow emanating from within. 'You've heard our songs,' it whispered, 'but you've never truly understood what we were singing about.' Then, in a voice that sounded like the echoes of a thousand dying screams, it began to sing once more.",

      "Billy":
        "What's interesting is how they use sound as a plot device. It makes you wonder if we're all just hearing echoes from the past in some way. Kind of like quantum physics, but for our ears!",

      "Meg":
        "Oh my gosh, I love that the daughter has black voids where her pupils should be! It's so eerie and adds to the overall sense of dread. I think I need to write a story about phantom music myself now.",

      "Kerry":
        "Yeah, but what if it's not just The Beatles? What if every song we hear is actually carrying some hidden message or warning from beyond? That would be so cool!",

      "Lui":
        "While the supernatural elements are well-executed, I think the story could have benefited from more character development. We need to know more about the daughter and her relationship with her father.",

      "Billy":
        "Speaking of relationships, isn't it fascinating how sound can evoke such strong emotional responses? The way that haunting melody affected both characters in the story mirrors some real scientific principles I've been studying.",
