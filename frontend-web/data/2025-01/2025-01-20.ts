    "It was the premiere of 'It Happened One Night' at the local cinema. The crowd was excited to see Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on the big screen. But as I sat in my seat, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.\n\n\n\nAs the lights dimmed and the movie began, I noticed a figure sitting in the row behind me. At first, I thought it was just another patron, but then I realized it was a woman with a pale face and sunken eyes. She seemed to be staring at the screen with an intensity that made my skin crawl.\n\n\n\nAs the movie played on, I tried to focus on the story, but my attention kept drifting back to the mysterious woman. She seemed to be...changing. Her face would contort into different expressions, and her eyes would gleam with a malevolent light.\n\n\n\nI tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but as the credits rolled and the lights came on, I saw the woman standing in front of me. She smiled at me, and I felt a chill run down my spine. 'It's not over yet,' she whispered, before disappearing into thin air.\n\n\n\nI stumbled out of the cinema, feeling like I was living in a nightmare. The premiere had been just a cover for something more sinister...and it was only just beginning.",
