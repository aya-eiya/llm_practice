    "As I walked through the streets of Paris, the smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of revolution. The year was 1967, and the city was alive with the spirit of change. I had come to join the students protesting against the war in Vietnam, but as I looked around at the sea of faces, I felt a sense of disconnection. That was when I saw her, standing on the edge of the crowd, her eyes shining with a fierce determination.  \n\n We locked eyes for what felt like an eternity, and I knew in that moment that I had found someone who understood me. Her name was Sophie, and she was a poet, driven by the same passion for justice that burned within me. As we talked, our words spilled out like a river, filling the spaces between us with a sense of belonging.  \n\n We danced through the streets, our feet moving in time as we chanted slogans and sang songs of revolution. The world around us was ablaze with colour and sound, but all I could see was Sophie's face, shining like a beacon in the chaos. And when the night finally came to an end, and the protests dispersed, I knew that I would never be the same again.",
