    "details":
      "On February 24, 1616, Pope Paul V issued a decree condemning Galileo's theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun as 'formally heretical'. The trial was held in Rome and resulted in Galileo being placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.",

  "body":
    "In a world where time was a fluid concept, I found myself in the midst of a trial that defied all logic. The accused, a man named Galileo, stood before me with a gaze that seemed to pierce through the very fabric of reality. His crime? A heresy so profound that it threatened to unravel the very threads of space and time itself.  \n\n As I listened to the prosecutor's arguments, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The evidence presented was flimsy at best, and the witnesses seemed more interested in proving their own importance than in telling the truth. And yet, despite the obvious flaws in the case, I felt a sense of inevitability wash over me.  \n\n Galileo's words echoed through my mind like a mantra: 'The universe is not for us to comprehend, but for us to explore.' I realized then that this trial was not about science or reason, but about the very nature of our existence. And in that moment, I knew that the verdict was already written.",
