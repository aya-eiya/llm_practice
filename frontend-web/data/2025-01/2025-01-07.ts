  "body":
    "In the year 2256, a group of scientists discovered an ancient artifact in the ruins of Rome. The artifact was a small crystal orb that glowed with a soft blue light. As soon as they touched it, they were transported to a futuristic city where they found themselves face to face with Emperor Hadrian himself.\n\n He explained that he had built the Pantheon as a time machine and that the crystal orb was its key. The scientists were amazed and asked him how he had managed to build such a complex device. Hadrian replied that it was all about understanding the power of language and grammar.\n\n 'The way you use words is like building a time machine,' he said. 'If you get it right, you can travel through history and change the course of events.' The scientists were intrigued and asked him to teach them more about this concept. Hadrian agreed and started to explain the basics of grammar and sentence structure.\n\n He showed them how to use modals, perfect tenses, and comparative forms to create complex sentences that could manipulate time itself.",
