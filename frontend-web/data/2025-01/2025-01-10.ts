    "In the year 2256, humanity had colonized the far reaches of the galaxy. The United Earth Government had established a terraformed planet, called New Eden, where humans could live in harmony with advanced technology and artificial intelligence.  \n\nAva, a brilliant scientist, stood at the forefront of a breakthrough discovery – a machine that could manipulate time itself. She named it Eternity's Echo, after the Eiffel Tower, which had opened to the public 267 years ago, on January 10, 1889.  \n\nAs Ava activated Eternity's Echo, the fabric of space-time began to unravel. The echoes of past events started to manifest in the present, creating a labyrinthine timeline. New Eden's inhabitants found themselves faced with multiple parallel universes and divergent timelines, each containing different versions of history.  \n\nAva realized that her creation had become an unstoppable force, threatening the very fabric of reality. She knew she had to shut down Eternity's Echo before it was too late, but the consequences of doing so would be catastrophic – potentially erasing entire civilizations from existence.",
