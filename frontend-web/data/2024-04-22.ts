    "In the small town of Mathville, everyone loved math. But one day, strange things started to happen. The numbers in the town suddenly began to change! The trees that used to be green turned into fractions and the houses that were once solid became sets. The people of Mathville were terrified. They knew they had to find out what was happening. So, they called upon their greatest mathematician, Professor Euclid. With his trusty calculator by his side, he set off on a journey to solve the mystery. He followed the numbers deeper and deeper into the unknown. But as he got closer, he realized that the numbers were alive! They had a mind of their own and were using their magic to change the town. Professor Euclid knew he had to stop them before it was too late. With the help of his friends, he battled the living numbers and finally defeated them. The people of Mathville were relieved and grateful. And from that day on, they made sure to always appreciate math and never take it for granted again.",

      "Kerry":
        "Totally agree! I was on the edge of my seat when Professor Euclid was battling those living numbers. Did you think he'd actually succeed?",

    {
      "Lui":
        "Indeed, Meg's imagination is quite impressive. But I have to say, as an educator, I'm concerned about the message this novel sends. It seems to suggest that math and numbers are somehow magical or alive, which might be misleading for young readers.",

    {
      "Billy":
        "I see what you mean, Mr. Lui. But isn't it possible to appreciate math without making it seem supernatural? I think Professor Euclid's approach is more realistic and shows the importance of understanding numbers in our daily lives.",

      "Kerry":
        "Yeah, Billy makes a good point! And who knows, maybe we can even find some real-life connections between math and magic",

      "Meg":
        "Ooh, that's a great idea, Kerry! Maybe we could write our own stories about numbers coming to life... or perhaps a superhero using math skills to save the day!",
    },
    {
      "Lui":
        "Well, I think that's a wonderful idea, Meg. It's always exciting to see students exploring their creativity and curiosity. Who knows what kind of innovative ideas they might come up with?",
