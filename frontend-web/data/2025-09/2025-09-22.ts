    "The year was 1564, and darkness crept through Florence like a thief in the night. Michelangelo Buonarroti lay upon his deathbed, surrounded by the cold stone that had witnessed his greatest triumphs. His once-bright eyes were now dimmed, reflecting only the flickering candles that danced across his pale face.\n\n\n\n The marble halls of the Medici Palace echoed with whispers and sobs as friends and family gathered to bid farewell to their beloved artist. The sculptor's final breath was lost in a haunting sigh, like the last whisper of a dying flame. Through the narrow windows of his chamber, moonlight filtered in, casting eerie shadows across his weathered features.\n\n\n\n As the life drained from Michelangelo's body, the angels on the nearby ceiling seemed to lean closer, as if drawn by some morbid fascination with his passing. His hands, which had once shaped such divine beauty in marble and stone, now lay still upon the white sheets beneath him.",

      "Meg":
