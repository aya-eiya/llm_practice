    "Sarah rushed into the mall, her backpack full of school supplies. The Texas sales tax holiday was in full swing, and she couldn't wait to stock up on everything from pencils to laptops without paying extra taxes.  \n\nHer best friend Emma had already filled three shopping bags with notebooks and folders. They met by the escalator, both wearing their new backpacks from last year's school supplies sale. 'Did you know that Texas was the first state to do this tax holiday?' Emma asked, showing Sarah her receipt.  \n\nTogether they continued their treasure hunt for the best deals on calculators and binders. The mall was packed with other students doing the same thing. Some parents joined in too, taking advantage of the lower prices. They made their way to the electronics store where the latest tablets were being discounted heavily.  \n\nAs they left the mall loaded down with bags, Sarah felt a sense of accomplishment. She had saved enough money on school supplies to buy a new laptop for her classes. 'This is why I love living in Texas,' she said to Emma as they headed home, both smiling about their shopping success.",
