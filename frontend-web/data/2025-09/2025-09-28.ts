    "details":
      "On September 28, 1952, Le Corbusier's iconic modernist villa, Villa Savoye, opened its doors to visitors in Poissy, France. The house was designed by Swiss-French architect Charles-Ã‰douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier) between 1928 and 1931 for the Savoye family.",

    "On Earth year 2152, Dr. Sophie Corbusier received a strange message from her ancestor, the famous architect Le Corbusier. The message contained coordinates for a mysterious location on Planet Alpha, where time was flowing differently. According to the notes, it was near a place called Villa Savoye, which had been converted into a futuristic research facility.\n\n Sophie gathered her team and prepared their advanced space vehicles for the journey. She knew that traveling through different times would be challenging, but she couldn't resist exploring this unusual phenomenon. The message also mentioned something about 'continuous tenses' and 'future perfect,' which sounded like complex mathematical calculations needed to navigate time properly.\n\n When they arrived at Villa Savoye, they were amazed by its modern design. The building had undergone a transformation beyond imagination - it now featured holographic gardens, transparent walls with views of multiple galaxies, and advanced technological systems that seemed to defy all laws of physics. Despite being in the year 2152, Sophie noticed that certain aspects of the villa's interior still reminded her of classic architecture from Earth's past.\n\n As they explored deeper into the facility, they discovered a hidden laboratory where scientists were working on something called 'quantum time travel.' The team was led by a brilliant scientist who had invented a revolutionary machine that could transport objects through different timelines without causing any paradoxes. Sophie couldn't help but wonder if this discovery would change humanity's understanding of space and time forever.",
