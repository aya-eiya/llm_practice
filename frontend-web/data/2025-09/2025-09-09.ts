  "title": "The Vitamin of Time",
  "body": "The copper clock tower in Steamworks City chimed with an unusual rhythm that evening. Professor Thimblewick, a brilliant but eccentric scientist, was conducting his most daring experiment yet - the creation of a vitamin capable of preserving memories and time itself.      \n\n His laboratory hummed with steam-powered contraptions as he meticulously measured each ingredient. The air around him filled with the smell of burning coal and boiling test tubes. His assistant, a young woman named Clara, stood by nervously, watching every move of her master.      \n\n 'This vitamin will change everything,' Thimblewick declared, his eyes gleaming with excitement as he added a final drop of amber liquid to the bubbling mixture. The reaction was immediate and spectacular - the solution turned from brown to bright yellow, like the sun rising over Steamworks City.      \n\n As they let the vitamin cool in its glass container, Clara couldn't help but wonder what kind of memories it might preserve. And whether Thimblewick's obsession with capturing time was worth the price of their sanity.",
