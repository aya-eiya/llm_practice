    "details":
      "Giordano Bruno, Italian philosopher, mathematician, poet, and astronomer who advocated for the Copernican model of the universe, was burned at the stake in Rome on September 19, 1600.

  "title": "The Burning Echo",
  "body":
    "As darkness descended upon Rome's ancient streets, Giordano Bruno's thoughts danced in the shadows of time. His burning body seemed to float, suspended between the earthly and celestial realms, as his spirit ascended through the layers of reality.\n\n\n\n The flames licked at his skin like a thousand hungry mouths, yet he felt no pain, only an exhilarating sensation of liberation from physical constraints. In this liminal state between life and death, Bruno witnessed visions that transcended the boundaries of human comprehension - celestial harmonies and cosmic symphonies.\n\n\n\n The Roman Inquisition's pyre became a crucible for his revolutionary ideas, where heresy transformed into pure intellectual ecstasy. His mind soared beyond the confines of earthly logic, embracing paradoxes and contradictions that painted vibrant hues across the canvas of existence.\n\n\n\n As the final embers dissolved into the evening air, Bruno's essence merged with the cosmos, becoming one with the very universe he had boldly proclaimed was infinite and eternal. His burning spirit ignited a spark within the collective consciousness of humanity, forever changing our understanding of the boundless mysteries that lay beyond the veil of the known.",

        "While this novel is certainly creative, it takes some historical liberties. As a teacher, I should mention that Bruno was more of an astronomer than a philosopher, but his ideas did influence later thinkers.",

      "Billy":
