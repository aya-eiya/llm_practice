    "It was midnight at Abbey Road Studios, and Sarah couldn't shake the eerie feeling that something wasn't right in this historic place. The ghost of John Lennon had been rumored to haunt these halls for decades, but tonight felt different.  \n\n As she wandered through the corridors, her flashlight beam caught glimpses of shadowy figures moving between the old recording booths. Every step echoed through the empty rooms, and a cold draft whispered past her ears despite the closed doors.  \n\n Suddenly, the lights flickered to life, revealing Paul McCartney standing at the mixing board. His eyes held a haunting familiarity, as if he had seen everything she would ever experience. 'The music never dies here,' he said in a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.  \n\n Sarah tried to scream but found her voice trapped in an endless loop of the Beatles' iconic melody. The studio's speakers crackled with life, and the band began their final performance all over again â€“ this time for eternity.",
