    "details":
      "MoMA was founded by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Paul Mellon, and others in 1929. The museum's first building opened on October 7, 1929, but due to the stock market crash, it remained closed for three years. It finally opened its doors to the public on December 14, 1932.",

    "The Museum of Modern Art stood silent in New York, its marble facade gleaming under moonlight. Inside, art pieces danced on their own rhythm, as if the paintings had taken lives of their own. They whispered stories to each other through the dark corridors, tales of Picasso's hearts and Van Gogh's dreams.  \n\n The guard who worked there every night began to notice how the artwork changed subtly with each passing day. A Monet landscape would shift colors ever so slightly, a Pollock painting would evolve its splatters into new patterns. It was as if time itself had become an artist within these hallowed halls.  \n\n One evening, as the guard was making his rounds, he saw a figure in the gallery - not a living person, but an apparition of Picasso himself, standing before his famous 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.' The painting seemed to breathe, its Cubist figures rotating in three dimensions. 'The art speaks for itself,' the ghost painter said, disappearing into the shadows with a knowing smile.  \n\n And so the Museum became a living entity, breathing new life into its timeless collection, where art and time merged like lovers meeting at midnight.",
