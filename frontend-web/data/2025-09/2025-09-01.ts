  "body": "In Beijing's streets, twelve-year-old Wei Ming felt the tremors of change beneath his feet. It was 1966, and the air was thick with anticipation as Chairman Mao's words echoed through the city's loudspeakers. The Cultural Revolution had begun, bringing with it a whirlwind of uncertainty and fear. \n\n Ming's father, once a proud government official, now spent his days reciting revolutionary slogans in the town square. His mother, a gentle soul who cherished traditional art forms, was forced to hide her beloved collection of classical paintings under their floorboards. The new rules demanded complete conformity to Mao's vision. \n\n Ming watched as neighbors transformed overnight into zealous Red Guards, patrolling streets with painted faces and armed with sticks. His best friend's father had been 'sent down' to a rural labor camp for daring to question the Party's methods. Fear and loyalty wrestled in every heart. \n\n In their secret moments of defiance, Ming and his schoolmates would whisper stories of ancient heroes who had stood against tyranny. Their teachers caught them often, but the forbidden tales lingered like embers in dark corners.",
