September was here, and like every other student in Germany, she had to face the first day of school after the summer break.  \n\n The hallways were bustling with life as students rushed around with their backpacks, chatting with friends they hadn't seen since June. Emma spotted her classmates in the distance, some looking confident while others seemed just as anxious as she felt.  \n\n Her teacher's voice boomed through the speakers welcoming everyone to a new school year. As she walked into the classroom, the smell of fresh paint and new textbooks filled the air. She took a deep breath and tried to make the best impression, remembering all the lessons her parents had taught her about making new friends.  \n\n The morning classes seemed to fly by as Emma got lost in her thoughts about what the year ahead might bring. With each passing hour, she felt more at ease, realizing that everyone was just as nervous as she was on their first day.",
