    "In the dead of night, I lay awake listening to every sound that echoed through our house on Pearl Harbor. My father had told me not to worry about the strange noises, but something wasn't right. The attack on Hawaii was three days ago now, and still, no news reached us here in Manila. \n\n The old radio in our living room crackled with static every night, like it was trying to tell us something important. I would often sneak out at midnight, my heart pounding against my chest as I walked through the dark streets. \n\n There were rumors flying around about Japanese spies being spotted near the harbor, but nobody knew for sure if they were just stories or the truth. My brother Tommy and I had become obsessed with finding out what really happened that night in Pearl Harbor. \n\n One evening, while following a mysterious truck through the city streets, we stumbled upon an old diary hidden under a stack of newspapers. Inside its yellowed pages, we found secrets about a traitor in our midst who helped plan the attack. \n\n The truth was far more shocking than any story we had heard before, and it would change everything we thought we knew about that fateful night.",
