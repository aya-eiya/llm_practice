They had always been fascinated by science, and now they had the chance to be part of something truly amazing.With their parents' permission, the children snuck out of school early and made their way to the lab where the discovery was made. When they arrived, they were greeted by a group of scientists who were more than happy to show them what they had done.The children listened in amazement as the scientists explained how they had used a powerful computer program to decipher the DNA code. They were shown images and diagrams of the double helix structure, and even got to see a real DNA molecule under a microscope.From that day on, the children knew they wanted to be scientists when they grew up. They spent every spare moment in the lab, learning everything they could about biotechnology and DNA. And who knows? Maybe one day, they would make their own incredible discovery. ",

      "Kerry": "But what about the Losers' Club? They're the ones who actually defeated It. I mean, who wouldn't want to be part of a gang of misfit heroes?"

    {
      "Meg": "I think the most fascinating aspect of the novel is how It's not just a creature, but a force that manipulates and controls our perceptions. It's like, what's real? What's just a product of our own imagination?"

      "Billy": "Exactly! That's why I love how King uses It as a metaphor for childhood trauma. The way it exploits their deepest fears and insecurities is so hauntingly relatable."

      "Billy": "I completely agree. But what do you guys think about the ending? Do you think the Losers' Club really defeated It, or is it just a temporary reprieve?"
    },
    {
      "Kerry": "Hmm, that's a tough one. I mean, it seems like they did manage to beat It, but then again, there are these hints throughout the novel that It's always lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next opportunity."
    },
    {
      "Meg": "Exactly! And that's what makes the ending so ambiguous – it leaves us wondering if It was truly defeated or just biding its time. I love how King leaves us with more questions than answers."
