  "body":
    "In a not so distant future, geometry was once a cornerstone of society, with mathematicians and scholars dedicating their lives to its study. However, as technology advanced and the world became more interconnected, the importance of geometry began to fade. People were no longer interested in understanding the fundamental principles that governed the universe; instead, they were consumed by the constant need for instant gratification and superficial pleasures. The once-great city of Alexandria, Egypt, where Euclid's famous book 'Elements' was published, now lay in ruins, a testament to the past. The few remaining scholars struggled to keep the knowledge of geometry alive, but they were met with indifference and ridicule by the general population. As the world descended into chaos and disorder, the study of geometry became a distant memory, lost in the sands of time.",
