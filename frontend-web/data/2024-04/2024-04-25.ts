He had trained for years to be a ninja, and he was ready for anything.He sneaked around the camp, avoiding the guards at all costs. Finally, he reached Tokugawa's tent. Inside, he saw that Tokugawa was planning to attack the village that very day. Akira knew he had to stop him.Akira quickly grabbed a sword and charged at Tokugawa. The two fought for hours, neither of them giving an inch. But in the end, Akira's quick thinking and ninja skills won out.Tokugawa was defeated, and the village was saved. Akira had done it. He was hailed as a hero and his name would be remembered in Japanese history.",
