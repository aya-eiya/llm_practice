    "In a world where technology had been all but lost, the remnants of humanity clung to what little remained. Among these relics was an ancient artifact, a small device that held the secrets of photography. Some believed it was nothing more than a relic from a bygone era, but a few dared to dream of its potential.  One such individual was a young girl named Ava. She had discovered the device in the ruins of what once was a bustling city, and she had spent countless hours studying its intricacies. Despite her lack of knowledge in the subject, her determination and curiosity were unmatched.  Finally, after months of research and experimentation, Ava managed to bring the device to life. As the screen flickered to life, a bright light filled the room, casting long shadows on the walls. The images that emerged were nothing short of miraculous. They were vivid and clear, capturing moments in time that no one had seen for centuries.  As word spread of Ava's discovery, people from all walks of life gathered to witness this marvel. Some were skeptical, but as the light from the device pierced through the darkness, they could not deny its power. And so, a new era of photography was born.",
