    "It was a cold and dreary October night when the small town of Abbeyville was suddenly plunged into darkness. The power lines had been cut, leaving the residents in complete darkness. As the clock struck midnight, strange noises began to echo through the streets. A cacophony of screams and laughter filled the air, coming from an abandoned building on the outskirts of town.  The following morning, a group of friends decided to investigate the source of the noises. Upon entering the old building, they were greeted by a chilling sight: several mannequins dressed in vintage 1960s clothing, arranged as if posing for a photo. The mannequins seemed to be alive, moving and speaking in hushed whispers.  As the night wore on, the group began to feel uneasy. The laughter of the mannequins grew louder, their movements more erratic. Suddenly, the lights flickered back on, revealing a shocking sight: several figures standing around the room, dressed in identical white outfits and holding red guitars.  The group realized that they were not alone in the building. The figures seemed to be waiting for something, their attention fixated on a large, open door at the end of the hall. As the clock struck midnight, the figures began to play a haunting melody, filling the air with eerie chords and howls.",
