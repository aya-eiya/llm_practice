This stone was guarded by the great queen Mumtaz, who ruled over her kingdom with an iron will. But one day, a wicked sorcerer attempted to steal the stone, and in its place, he left a small pebble, vowing to return when the great queen passed away.Years later, on the day of the first stone laying ceremony for the Taj Mahal, a group of brave adventurers set out on a quest to find the lost crystal. They traveled through treacherous landscapes, braving danger at every turn, until they finally discovered the small pebble that had replaced the great queen's precious stone.With the help of the queen's loyal followers, they worked tirelessly to build a magnificent mausoleum in her honor, using the stone as its foundation.
