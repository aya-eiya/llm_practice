    "In the early 1830s, a young inventor named Louis Daguerre was determined to create an instrument that could capture the beauty of the world around him. He had been fascinated by the power of light and shadow for years, but he knew that there must be a way to immortalize these fleeting moments in time.  After countless experiments and setbacks, Louis finally stumbled upon a breakthrough. He discovered that by using a silver-coated copper plate and exposing it to iodine vapor, he could create an image that was both clear and detailed.  Over the next few months, Louis worked tirelessly to perfect his process. He knew that he had something truly remarkable on his hands, and he couldn't wait to share it with the world.  On April 14, 1839, Louis stood in front of a crowd of eager spectators and demonstrated his daguerreotype process for the first time. The audience was mesmerized by the sight of the image slowly emerging on the plate before their eyes.  It was a moment that would change the course of history, as photography was finally brought to the masses. Louis' invention would pave the way for future developments in the field and would inspire countless others to explore the world through the lens of a camera.",

      "Kerry":
        "Yeah, and it's crazy to think about all the things we take for granted today because of his invention. Like, have you ever seen an old photograph and thought about what it must've been like back then?",
