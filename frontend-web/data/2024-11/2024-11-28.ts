    "The darkness was absolute, a physical presence that suffocated me. I stumbled through the abandoned laboratory, my footsteps echoing off the cold walls. The air was thick with the scent of decay and forgotten dreams.  \n\n It had been years since ENIAC's dedication ceremony at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. The first electronic computer, a marvel of its time, now lay in ruins. I felt a strange connection to this relic of the past, as if it held secrets that only I could hear.  \n\n As I delved deeper into the lab, the shadows seemed to writhe and twist around me like living things. I began to feel a creeping sense of dread, as if something was watching me from just beyond the edge of perception. Suddenly, the lights flickered to life, casting an eerie glow over the room.  \n\n The computer's screen sprang to life, displaying a message in bold, accusatory letters: 'ENIAC IS ALIVE.' I spun around, but there was no one behind me. The words seemed to be speaking directly to me, taunting me with the knowledge that I was not alone in this abyss of darkness and madness.",
