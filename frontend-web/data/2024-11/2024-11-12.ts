    "It was a dark and stormy night when I stumbled upon the old abandoned CERN laboratory. The once-thriving center of technological innovation now stood as a haunted monument to the power of human knowledge. As I cautiously entered the building, the creaking of the rusty gates echoed through the deserted halls, like the whispers of restless spirits.  \n\n My flashlight cast an eerie glow on the dusty equipment and forgotten experiments. It was then that I stumbled upon an old computer terminal, its screen flickering with a faint blue light. Suddenly, the words 'The First Web Page Served' appeared on the screen, followed by a date: November 12, 1990. A chill ran down my spine as I realized that this was the exact moment when the World Wide Web was born.  \n\n But something was amiss. The terminal began to malfunction, and the words started to change, forming a sinister message: 'You should not have come here.' I tried to flee, but it was too late. The laboratory's security system activated, trapping me inside. As the darkness closed in around me, I knew that I had unleashed a horror beyond human comprehension. The Web of Darkness had consumed me.",
