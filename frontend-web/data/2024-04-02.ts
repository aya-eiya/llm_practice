  "title": "Discovery of Neptune",
  "body": "On April 2nd, 1846, Uranus was observed to have a strange orbit that didn't match the predictions of Newton's laws. The French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier calculated the position where a new planet should be located and sent his calculations to German astronomer Johann Galle. On September 23rd, Galle used a telescope to locate the new planet, which he named Neptune. This discovery was a major event in science history because it showed that even the best scientific theories could have limitations and that there were still many mysteries to be uncovered about our universe.",
