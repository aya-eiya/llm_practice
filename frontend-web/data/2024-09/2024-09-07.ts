    "It was a typical Wednesday evening when the power grid collapsed, plunging the city into darkness. At first, people thought it was just a minor outage, but as the hours ticked by and the lights remained off, panic began to set in.  \n\n I was driving home from work when my car's GPS suddenly malfunctioned, leading me down a series of increasingly narrow streets. As I navigated through the maze-like roads, I noticed that the buildings around me were becoming increasingly decrepit, as if they had been abandoned for years.  \n\n It wasn't until I stumbled upon a group of looters, armed to the teeth and raiding a local convenience store, that I realized the true extent of the situation. The city was on the brink of chaos, and it seemed like nobody knew what to do.  \n\n As I watched in horror, the looters began to move out into the streets, taking advantage of the power outage to wreak havoc on the city. I knew I had to get out of there, but as I turned to leave, I realized that my car was stuck in a dead-end alley, surrounded by the very same looters who had just terrorized the convenience store.",
