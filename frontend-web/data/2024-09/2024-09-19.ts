    "It was supposed to be a night like any other in New York City. But as I stepped out of the subway tunnel, I felt it - a strange, unsettling energy that seemed to vibrate through every cell in my body.  \n\nI tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but as I walked through the crowded streets, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. And then, without warning, the lights went out. The city was plunged into darkness, and chaos erupted all around me.  \n\nPanic set in as people screamed and ran for cover. But I knew I had to keep my head - I'd seen a news report earlier that day about a mysterious energy anomaly that had been detected near the city's power grid. And now, it seemed, we were facing the consequences.  \n\nI stumbled through the darkness, desperate to find a way out of this nightmare. But as I pushed through the crowds, I realized that I wasn't alone - there were others like me, people who'd been... changed by the anomaly. And they were coming for me.",
