    "In the year 2256, humanity had finally reached the pinnacle of technological advancement. The invention of the Eternal Loop, a device capable of preserving memories forever, had revolutionized the way people lived and interacted. The city of New Elysium was a marvel of modern science, where every citizen's memories were stored in a vast digital repository.  \n\n But as with all great power, the Eternal Loop came with a terrible cost. The memory of eternity itself began to fade away, like sand slipping through the fingers of time. People forgot their past, their loved ones, and their very own identities. The once-great civilization was now on the brink of collapse.  \n\n Amidst this chaos, a young scientist named Maya stumbled upon an ancient relic from the pre-Eternal Loop era. It was a small, intricately carved box containing a single memory – the completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. As she held the box, Maya felt a spark of hope ignite within her. She knew that this one memory could be the key to restoring humanity's connection to eternity itself.",
