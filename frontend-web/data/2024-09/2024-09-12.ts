    "The night was dark and stormy when I received a call from Inspector James, asking me to meet him at Willow Manor. It seemed that the old mansion, which had been abandoned for decades, was on fire. As I arrived, flames were licking at the windows, and smoke was billowing into the air.  \n\n I watched in horror as the inspector and his team fought to contain the blaze. But it soon became clear that this was no ordinary fire. The mansion's interior was a labyrinth of narrow corridors and hidden rooms, making it impossible to pinpoint the source of the flames.  \n\n As we searched for answers, I stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall: 'The truth is in the ashes.' What did it mean? Was this fire merely an accident, or was something more sinister at play?  \n\n I knew then that I had to dig deeper. The Fire at Willow Manor was not just a tragic event, but a mystery waiting to be unraveled.",
