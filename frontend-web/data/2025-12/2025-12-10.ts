    "event": "The Galileo Affair - Decree Against Galileo Galilei",
    "details":
      "On December 10, 1616, Pope Paul V issued a decree that placed Galileo under house arrest for promoting heliocentric theory. The Holy Office (Inquisition) declared the Copernican system heretical and prohibited anyone from defending or teaching it. This decree was issued after a visit by Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, who warned Galileo about his teachings.",

    "The moon cast long shadows across the Vatican courtyard as Cardinal Bellarmine approached Galileo's cell door with measured steps. \n\n His face was grim beneath his white cassock, and his eyes held a warning that made Galileo shiver. The air inside the room felt heavy with unspoken words, like the weight of a thousand stones crushing down on him. \n\n 'You understand the gravity of your situation,' Bellarmine said in hushed tones, his voice barely above a whisper. Galileo nodded silently, knowing that any defiance would only seal his fate worse than death itself. The Cardinal's words echoed through his mind like a dark prophecy: 'The Holy Office declares the Copernican system heretical.' \n\n Outside, the night wind howled its mournful song across Rome's ancient rooftops as Galileo was led away to begin his sentence of house arrest. His mind wandered back to the telescopes in Florence, to the stars that seemed to whisper the truth he had brought to light. But now, those same truths would condemn him to silence, forever trapped between earth and sky, unable to share the wonders he had witnessed with anyone who might believe.",
