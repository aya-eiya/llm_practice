  "body": "The jury watched as forensic expert Dr. Sarah Whitman explained the devastating events of that fateful night in June. '\n\n The fire started with a small electrical fault on the fourth floor,' she testified, her voice steady despite the gravity of the situation.  '\n\n When residents tried to escape using the stairwell, they found it blocked by locked metal gates and burning debris.' She paused, adjusting her glasses. 'The tragic truth is that many people died because they couldn't get out.'  '\n\n As we continued our investigation,' she went on, 'we discovered that the building's exterior cladding was made of highly flammable materials, making it extremely susceptible to fire.' The judge nodded slowly, his expression grave. 'The evidence clearly shows a catastrophic failure in safety protocols and maintenance standards.'  '\n\n Now, we must determine whether this tragedy could have been prevented if proper safety measures had been in place,' the expert concluded firmly. 'And more importantly, how can we ensure that such a disaster never happens again?' The jury exchanged worried glances as they contemplated the devastating consequences of what could only be described as a preventable catastrophe.",
