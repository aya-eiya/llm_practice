  "body": "The ancient temple loomed in the moonlight as Detective Maya Santos stepped inside. The air was thick with mystery and the scent of sacred herbs. This wasn't just any case - it was a Winter Solstice murder.  \n\n 'The victim was found at dawn,' explained Dr. Rodriguez, the local historian. 'In the exact position of the sun god Inti.' Maya knew this was no coincidence. The killer had chosen their moment carefully, timing the crime with an ancient ritual.  \n\n As she examined the scene, Maya noticed strange symbols carved into the victim's chest. They looked familiar - like something from her grandmother's old stories about Mayan ceremonies. But what did they mean?  \n\n 'The Winter Solstice is coming up soon,' Dr. Rodriguez continued. 'And whoever killed him wanted to send a message.' Maya felt a chill run down her spine. In this ancient temple, surrounded by the mystery of an old civilization, she was about to uncover a secret that had been hidden for centuries.",
