  "body": "The Cavern Club pulsed with neon life as I slipped through its doors. The once-famous stage now hosted a holographic band, their images shimmering like ghosts against the black walls. It was 2081, and memories of The Beatles' first concert in this very place seemed ancient now.\n\n\n\nIn the shadows behind the bar, I spotted an old man with a silver guitar case. His eyes sparkled as he recognized me - one of the few who still remembered the past. 'You shouldn't be here,' he whispered, his voice crackling like an old vinyl record.\n\n\n\nBefore I could respond, a sleek black drone whizzed through the air, its red LED eyes scanning everyone in sight. The hologram band faltered as it approached, their synthesized music turning to static. In that moment of silence, we all heard it - a haunting melody from decades ago, echoing through the club like a ghostly refrain.\n\n\n\nThe old man smiled, and I saw memories flash behind his eyes - memories of The Beatles' first concert, when they were just four young men with dreams bigger than their city. In this cyberpunk Liverpool, where time flowed like digital data, those echoes remained - a reminder that some music transcends even the laws of physics.",
