  "body": "The stock market began a dramatic decline on December 28, 1929, known as 'Black Thursday'. Though initially not considered a major crash by some, this day marked the beginning of one of history's most significant economic downturns. The event sparked widespread panic and loss of investor confidence in the financial markets. \n\n In that moment of chaos, millions of investors lost their life savings overnight. It was like watching a great city burn to the ground, but instead of flames, it was fear spreading through Wall Street like wildfire. \n\n As darkness fell over New York City, people stood in awe at the streets below, their eyes fixed on the stock market ticker that showed one catastrophic number after another. The whole nation seemed to be holding its breath as if waiting for a final, fatal drop. \n\n The crash became more than just an economic disaster – it was a psychological nightmare. For weeks, people walked around with glazed eyes and trembling hands, haunted by the ghost of what could have been their own futures.",
