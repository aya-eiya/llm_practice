    "details":
      "On December 25th, 1843, William Fothergill Colville sent the first ever Christmas message via telegraph from Liverpool to London, England. This marked a significant milestone in communication history as it was the first time people could send seasonal greetings across long distances.",

    "It was Christmas Eve when I first noticed something strange about my telegraph machine. The old copper wires seemed to pulse with a faint, sickly light, and I could have sworn I heard a faint whisper coming from its depths.\n\n\n\n As I prepared to send the last message of the day, the machine began to move on its own, keys clicking frantically as if possessed by some malevolent spirit. The words 'Merry Christmas' appeared on my screen, but something was terribly wrong with those letters.\n\n\n\n What happened next defied all logic. Each time I sent a message through the telegraph, a ghostly voice would respond from across the wire - first in whispers, then in screams that could shake the very foundations of our Victorian buildings.\n\n\n\n By Christmas morning, the entire city was gripped by terror as more and more people reported hearing voices on their telegraphs. The spirits of those who had died in the early days of telegraphy were bound to their machines, trapped between worlds, unable to rest until every soul they had touched could hear their final message.",
