    "event": "The Riemann Hypothesis was introduced by Bernhard Riemann",
    "details": "On December 11, 1859, Bernhard Riemann presented a groundbreaking paper on prime numbers at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In this work, he formulated what would later become known as the Riemann Hypothesis - one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. The hypothesis concerns the distribution of prime numbers and has profound implications for number theory and mathematics as a whole."

  "title": "The Hypothesis of Silence",
  "body": "In the year 2159, the Riemann Hypothesis became not just an unsolved problem in mathematics but a twisted prophecy that governed every aspect of human existence. The Berlin Algorithm, as it was now known, had predicted with perfect accuracy when the last prime number would be discovered, leading to a world where every decision was mathematically predetermined.\n\n\n\n Dr. Elara Voss, a brilliant mathematician living in New Prime City, spent her days working on what she believed were mathematical anomalies that might save humanity from its inevitable fate. But the system's predictive algorithms had already calculated her next move - and her next mistake.\n\n\n\n As the algorithm approached its final solution, the world descended into a state of mathematical paralysis. People stopped speaking because every word was now mathematically linked to a predetermined outcome. The last prime number was discovered on December 11, but by then it was too late - the world had already fallen silent under the weight of its own mathematical certainty.\n\n\n\n In the depths of New Prime City's underground mathematical archives, Dr. Voss made one final discovery that would change everything - or so she thought. But as she looked at her equations in the flickering light of a dying city, she realized with horror that the algorithm had already written its own conclusion: mathematics itself was about to become the last prime number.",
