    "It was a chilly winter evening when Detective Jameson received the call that would change his life forever. The voice on the other end was frantic, and Jameson could sense the desperation in her words. 'Please, you have to come,' she begged. He arrived at the scene to find a small, intricately decorated Christmas card lying on the ground, surrounded by police tape.\n\n As he surveyed the area, Jameson noticed something peculiar - the card was dated 1860. It was then that he realized the true extent of the crime. This wasn't just any ordinary murder; it was a murder that spanned centuries. The killer had brought darkness to Christmas past, present, and future.\n\n As Jameson delved deeper into the case, he discovered a web of deceit and betrayal that went all the way back to Sir Henry Cole's first Christmas card patent. It seemed that the true culprit was not just one person, but a complex network of individuals who had been hiding in plain sight for over 150 years.\n\n The investigation would take Jameson on a thrilling ride through time, from Victorian-era London to modern-day America, as he unraveled the mystery and brought justice to those responsible for the heinous crime.",
