    "In the year 2154, humanity had colonized several planets in the distant reaches of the galaxy. The city of New Eden on the planet of Xylophia-IV was a marvel of modern technology, with towering skyscrapers and advanced artificial intelligence. But amidst its gleaming surface, the city harbored a dark secret.\n\n\n\n A mysterious phenomenon had begun to occur, where people's thoughts and memories were being echoed back to them from unknown sources. At first, it was just whispers in the wind, but soon it became full-blown echoes of conversations from days past. The citizens of New Eden were both fascinated and terrified by this development.\n\n\n\n As the echoes grew louder and more frequent, a young scientist named Maya began to investigate their cause. She discovered that an ancient alien technology had been unearthed deep beneath the city's foundation, which was now disrupting the fabric of reality itself. The echoes were not just random sounds – they were actual memories from people who no longer existed.\n\n\n\n With this knowledge, Maya realized that New Eden was on the cusp of a great catastrophe. The echoes would soon become a tidal wave of forgotten pasts, threatening to engulf the entire city and everyone in it.",
