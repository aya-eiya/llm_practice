    "I stood frozen in front of the antique mirror, my eyes fixed on the reflection staring back at me. It was a day like any other, but something felt off, as if the shadows cast by the sunlight streaming through the window were alive and moving of their own accord.  \n\n As I gazed deeper into the glass, I began to notice something strange - my reflection seemed... different. The eyes that looked back at me seemed darker, more sinister, as if they belonged to a person I didn't know. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.  \n\n But then I saw her. A figure emerged from the shadows behind me, her eyes locked onto mine with an unblinking gaze. She was tall and gaunt, her skin as white as the marble that surrounded us. I tried to scream, but my voice was frozen in my throat as she reached out a bony hand and touched the glass.  \n\n The mirror shattered into a thousand pieces, releasing a chill wind that sent shivers down my spine. As I stumbled backward, I saw her smile - a cold, calculating smile that seemed to say, 'You should have stayed hidden.' And then she was gone, leaving me to face the darkness that lurked within myself.",
