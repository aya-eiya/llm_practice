    "It was December 16, 1926, and John Logie Baird had just demonstrated the first public television transmission from a small two-story house at Selfridge's Department Store in London. But little did anyone know that this moment of innovation would unleash a darkness that would haunt the store forever.  \n\n As the night fell, strange things began to happen. The lights flickered and the cameras started to roll on their own. People whispered about seeing shadowy figures lurking around the store. It was as if something from the screen had spilled out into reality.  \n\n I was one of the first to witness this supernatural phenomenon. I saw a figure in a black coat walking towards me, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. I tried to run, but my feet felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot. The figure drew closer and closer until it vanished into thin air.  \n\n The next day, the store was closed due to 'technical difficulties.' But people whispered about the true cause of the closure - something had invaded the world from the television screen, and Selfridge's would never be the same again.",

      "Lui":
        "As a historian, I appreciated the nod to the actual event in 1926. It added a layer of depth to the story. However, I felt like the pacing could have been tightened up in some areas.",

      "Billy":
