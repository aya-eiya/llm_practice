    "The streets of Addis Ababa were always crowded, but tonight they seemed to be on fire. The smell of smoke and sweat filled the air as protesters clashed with police in a frenzy of anger and frustration.  \n\n Detective Jameson watched from across the street, his eyes fixed on the young woman who had just been dragged into the chaos. She was one of many who had been arrested during the day, but this was different. This was personal.  \n\n Jameson knew her as Amina, a former classmate and friend who had become increasingly involved in the revolution against Emperor Haile Selassie's government. He had lost touch with her over the years, but seeing her now brought back memories of their time at university.  \n\n As he approached the police line, Jameson was stopped by a sergeant who eyed him suspiciously. 'You're not involved in this, are you?' the man growled. Jameson shook his head, trying to look as innocent as possible. But the truth was, he was in deep.",
