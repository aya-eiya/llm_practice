    "In a steam-powered city where time was money, a brilliant inventor named Adelaide worked tirelessly to create the perfect clock. One fateful night, while tinkering with her latest invention in her cluttered workshop, an explosion rocked the room, scattering gears and cogs across the floor. As the smoke cleared, Adelaide realized that she had unwittingly unleashed a terrible secret: a mechanical monster, born from the fusion of her latest creation and an ancient artifact, had begun to wreak havoc on the city. With the fate of the city hanging in the balance, Adelaide must race against time to stop the monster before it destroys everything she has ever known.",
