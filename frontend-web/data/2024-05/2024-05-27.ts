    "In the summer of 1826, in the small town of Le Gras in France, a young inventor named Joseph Nicéphore Niépce was on the brink of a groundbreaking discovery. For years, he had been tinkering with new ways to capture images, but nothing seemed to work. That was until one day, when out of nowhere, inspiration struck him like a bolt of lightning.  Niépce decided to experiment with using a camera obscura, an instrument used by artists to sketch the outlines of objects, and combining it with the power of light to create images that could be reproduced. After months of trial and error, he finally succeeded in taking the first permanent photograph. The image was of his own backyard, but for Niépce, it was a masterpiece.  The news of his invention quickly spread throughout Europe, and soon enough, other inventors began to experiment with photography as well. It wasn't long before this new art form became all the rage in the world of art and science.",
