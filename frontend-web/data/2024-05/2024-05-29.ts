    'In a faraway land, a young girl named Anya lived in a small village. One day, she wandered into the forest and came across a beautiful lake. As she sat by the water\'s edge, she saw a flock of swans swimming towards her. The swans were led by a magnificent white swan with a golden crown. Anya was amazed by the swans\' beauty. She had never seen anything like them before. As the swans got closer, she noticed that the white swan was wearing a necklace with a large ruby. Suddenly, the white swan spoke to Anya in a human voice."Hello, Anya," said the swan. "I am the Swan Queen. I have been watching you, and I know that you have a kind heart. I would like to give you a gift."The Swan Queen reached into the water and pulled out a golden egg. She handed the egg to Anya."This egg contains the magic of the swans," said the Swan Queen. "It will grant you one wish."Anya was so happy. She thanked the Swan Queen and ran home to tell her family about her adventure.',
