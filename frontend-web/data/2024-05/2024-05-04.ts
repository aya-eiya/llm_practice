  "body":
    "On a stormy night in May 1787, the renowned German writer and philosopher, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, met Friedrich Schiller, another prominent German playwright and poet, at the home of Christoph Martin Wieland in Weimar, Germany. As they spoke, they were interrupted by a group of robbers who demanded their valuables. In a moment of action, Goethe grabbed his trusty pistol and engaged the robbers in a fierce gunfight. Schiller, a former soldier, joined in with his sword, leading the charge against the criminals. Together, they fought off the robbers and saved the valuable manuscripts that were being threatened by the thieves. This encounter marked the beginning of their significant literary friendship, as they exchanged ideas about the power of action in literature.",
