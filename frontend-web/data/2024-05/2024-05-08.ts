      "German Zeppelin L-70 shoots down British biplane R36/45 over Cuxhaven, Germany.",
    "details":
      "On May 8th, 1921, a German airship LZ-70, a rigid airship also known as a zeppelin, was conducting a routine flight when it spotted a British biplane R36/45 flying in the vicinity. The zeppelin's gunner mistook the biplane for an enemy aircraft and opened fire, shooting down the plane and killing its pilot, Flight Lieutenant Frederick Herman Parker.",

  "title": "The Zeppelin's Mistake",
  "body":
    "In a world where airships were the cutting edge of technology, the German LZ-70 and British R36/45 were two of the most advanced aircraft. One day, as they were on their respective missions, the LZ-70 spotted the R36/45 in its flight path. Without hesitation, the zeppelin's gunner opened fire, believing it to be an enemy aircraft. However, the biplane was not a threat and was piloted by Flight Lieutenant Frederick Herman Parker. The unfortunate event left the pilot dead and tensions between the two nations escalated. As the world mourned the loss of such a brilliant mind, both countries were left to wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided.",
