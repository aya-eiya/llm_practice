That morning, a helicopter dropped explosives on their headquarters, killing eleven people and injuring over two hundred others.Sixteen-year-old Maria lived just blocks away from the bombing site. She woke up to sirens blaring and smoke rising into the sky. As she ran outside, she saw the chaos unfolding before her eyes. The police had raided MOVE's headquarters, and now the neighborhood was on fire.Maria didn't know what to do. She had always been a bystander, watching from afar as the world around her crumbled. But now, she couldn't ignore it anymore. She joined a group of people who were trying to help put out the fires and evacuate those affected by the bombing.As they worked together, Maria realized that she couldn't just be an observer anymore. She had to take action and make a difference in her community. And so, she decided to join MOVE and fight for their cause.From that day on, Maria became an activist, fighting for justice and equality for all. Eleven eleventh would always be a reminder of the tragedy that occurred, but it also marked the beginning of Maria's journey to make a difference in the world.",
