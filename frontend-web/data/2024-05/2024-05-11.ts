    "Seventeen-year-old Katie had always been fascinated by the Great Fire of London, which she had learned about in school. When her parents announced that they were moving to London for a new job opportunity, Katie was thrilled at the chance to explore the city firsthand and even more so when she found out that their new home was located on Pudding Lane, the very street where the fire had started. However, as Katie explored the city with her best friend, Luke, she began to notice strange things happening around them - objects moving on their own, whispers in the wind, and a sense of unease settling over the city. It wasn't until a mysterious letter arrived at their door, warning them about an ancient curse that had been unleashed during the Great Fire, that Katie realized something was terribly wrong. With the help of Luke and a few new friends they meet along the way, Katie must navigate through the dangers of London in the midst of the fire, all while trying to break the curse before it's too late.",
