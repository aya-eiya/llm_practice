    "In the year 2178, humanity had colonized several planets in the distant reaches of the galaxy. The United Earth Government had formed an alliance with the alien species, known as the Xantheans, to ensure a peaceful coexistence among the stars. However, tensions began to rise as the two factions disagreed on the implementation of a new treaty, similar to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that had been signed on Earth in 1918.  \n\n The treaty, which aimed to bring an end to the war between Russia and the Central Powers, had been seen as a turning point in history. It marked a shift from a brutal and bloody conflict to a more civilized and diplomatic approach. As humanity looked out into the stars, they sought to replicate this success on a galactic scale.  \n\n But as the negotiations between the United Earth Government and the Xantheans continued to stall, it became clear that the two sides were far apart. The Xantheans demanded more concessions from humanity, while the United Earth Government refused to give in to their demands. As tensions escalated, it seemed as though another war was inevitable.  \n\n Yet, amidst the chaos and uncertainty, a small group of diplomats managed to find a way forward. They proposed a compromise that would satisfy both sides and pave the way for a lasting peace between humanity and the Xantheans. It was a fragile agreement, but it offered a glimmer of hope in a troubled galaxy.",
