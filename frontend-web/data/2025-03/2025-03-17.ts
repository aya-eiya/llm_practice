    "In the year 2154, humanity had finally reached the pinnacle of technological advancement. The city of New Eden was a marvel of modern science, with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping through the air. But amidst all this progress, a mysterious phenomenon began to occur.   \n\n People started to disappear, only to reappear years later with no memory of where they had been or what had happened to them. The government was baffled, and scientists were stumped. It wasn't until a young woman named Maya stumbled upon an ancient artifact that the truth began to unravel.  \n\n As Maya delved deeper into the mystery, she discovered that the disappearances were not random events, but rather a consequence of a time loop that had been created by an advanced civilization from the past. The artifact, it turned out, was a key to unlocking the secrets of this ancient technology. With her newfound knowledge, Maya set out to prevent the catastrophic event that would eventually destroy the world.",
