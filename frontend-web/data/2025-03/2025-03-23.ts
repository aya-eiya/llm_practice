    "In the year 2154, humanity had finally achieved what was thought to be impossible â€“ a transcontinental tunnel that connected the East and West Coasts of the United States. The tunnel, named 'The Great Bridge,' was a marvel of modern engineering, allowing for effortless travel between the two coasts in mere minutes.  \n\n But with great power comes great responsibility. As people began to use The Great Bridge, strange occurrences started to happen. People would disappear while traveling through the tunnel, only to reappear on the other side with no memory of their journey. At first, it was thought to be just a glitch in the system, but as more and more people went missing, it became clear that something was very wrong.  \n\n The government was quick to cover up the incident, citing 'technical difficulties' as the reason for the disappearances. But a small group of rebels, led by a young woman named Maya, were determined to get to the bottom of things. They snuck into the tunnel, avoiding security patrols and making their way deeper into the heart of The Great Bridge.",
