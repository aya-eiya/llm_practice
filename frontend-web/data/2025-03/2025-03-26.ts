    "In the city of lights, where the Eiffel Tower pierced the sky like a shard of glass, there existed a university that defied the laws of reality. The University of Paris, established by King Philip II on March 26, 1200, had become a dreamworld, a realm where the fabric of time and space was woven with an infinite thread of possibilities.  \n\n Students roamed the halls, their minds afire with the curiosity of a thousand midnights. They delved into the labyrinthine corridors, seeking answers to questions that had never been asked. The faculty, wise and enigmatic, guided them through the twists and turns of knowledge, their words dripping with an otherworldly sweetness.  \n\n In this realm, phrasal verbs danced like butterflies on a summer's day, their meanings shifting and morphing like a mirage in the desert. Idiomatic expressions whispered secrets to those who listened, and articles and quantifiers wove a tapestry of precision and accuracy. It was here, in the University of Paris' dreamscape, that the impossible became possible, and the boundaries of reality were stretched to their limits.",
