    "The darkness that had shrouded the land for centuries was about to lift, but at a terrible cost. As the last remnants of sunlight faded from the sky, a sense of foreboding settled over the crumbling spires and turrets of the ancient city.\n\n\n\n It was on this very night, in a long-forgotten era, that the Raising of Lazarus had taken place – an event so momentous, it would change the course of history. But little did anyone know, that same power would soon be unleashed upon the world once more.\n\n\n\n The wind howled through the deserted streets like a chorus of lost souls, as a figure emerged from the shadows. His eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity, as he raised his hands to the heavens and began to chant. The words were ancient, yet they seemed to stir something deep within the earth itself.\n\n\n\n As the night wore on, the ground began to tremble and the skies grew dark. It was then that the first signs of awakening appeared – tendrils of mist that curled around the city like skeletal fingers. The air was heavy with anticipation, for it seemed that the very fabric of reality was about to be torn apart.",
